Y’all, it has been a _wild_ two weeks since the US shot down three UFOs that turned out to be hobby balloons. The Pentagon is being weird about the balloons, the Senate is being weird about UAP, some sources claim the Navy told Biden that the Air Force is lying to him about UAP, and possibly as a result, Biden created his own independent UAP task force. Oh, and also, the Obama Library has thousands of pages of records about UAP? What is happening?
