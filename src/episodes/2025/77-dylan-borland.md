Following his appearance at the recent Congressional UAP hearing, whistleblower Dylan Borland gave an extended interview to George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell, expanding on his claims of firsthand knowledge of crash retrieval and reverse engineering programs, and the reprisals he’s suffered, including medical malpractice and attempts to kill him. He also claims that the government has recovered tic tac UFOs from archeological dig sites!

- Corbell: “ You were exposed specifically to proof about UAP reverse engineering in official capacity, meaning while you're at work… What is it that you saw and found out and can tell us about?”
  - Borland: “What I will say is this: I have direct, firsthand knowledge and exposure to crash recoveries, reverse engineering, integration of technology into [redacted], as well as the most important piece of technology on the planet. And it’s not the craft themselves.”
  - Corbell: “It would be the power source.”
  - Borland: “You can make that assessment yourself.”
- Corbell: “ So you have direct knowledge… from your official work capacity… of UAP being actual craft of unknown or non-human origin.”
  - Borland: “ 100%. Not only do I have it, I testified to it. I provided materials proving it… [including] three… drawings. One, [of the triangle,] was unclassified, and the other two were immediately thrown into a Special Access Program. The two that were thrown into a SAP prove we are not alone.”

## Langley AFB

- Borland: “Summer of 2012… I leave the ops floor [at]… 1:30 in the morning… I go into the gazebo [by my barracks] and I’m… smoking a cigarette. I’m on the phone with my buddy… I see a white light pop up from the NASA hangar… and in my mind I think, oh, weather balloon test… No big deal.”
- Borland: “I start walking up to where this light is hovering above the NASA hangar and… the white light flies across the flight line to me… All of a sudden, while it's flying to me, a [100-150 foot equilateral] triangle appears. I can't tell you if it was an active camouflage. I cannot tell you if it manifested around it. The only thing I can tell you is that light came and a triangle appeared around it…”
- Borland: “ My cell phone gets incredibly hot and completely freezes and shuts down. I'm under it and I, the first thought in my mind is literally, okay, so this is real too.”
- Borland: “ I'm under it three to five minutes, and all of a sudden the center light flashes… That thing shoots off to commercial air jet level.  it gets to that flight level in seconds, like three seconds. Easy.  And after a few minutes it goes due east out over the bay out into the Atlantic Ocean.  I made the point that it did not go to Norfolk, which is where the naval station is. That didn't go up north towards the marine station.”
- Borland “At that moment, I feel static electricity all over my body, and I immediately, immediately smell a rainstorm lightning storm, like a strong lightning thunderstorm. That smell you smell after.”
- Borland: “ My phone, I'm able to reset it… I want to take a picture of it… and the only light I could see is the center light… If I did not witness it take off, that would've looked like a star…  I kick myself to this day 'cause I'm looking at my phone and [thinking] should I keep this? No one's ever gonna believe it. You can't see anything… but the date and time are in there. I'm an idiot. And I erased it.”
- Knapp: “ Did it seem to be reacting to you because you'd seen it?”
  - Borland: “That is one of the questions I would love to know because it's one of the things that keeps me up at night, which is why did it fly across the base to me?”
- Knapp: “ Is there a process that you would follow for something like that? Hey, tell your commanding officer or file a written report or what?”
  - Borland: “ So there's no process at all. I told a couple of my friends and there was a couple sergeants who had heard me talking one night, and one of them actually told me… Dylan, you never talk about this. And I was like, funny man… He's like, no, trust me. Don't talk about it. I thought it was a joke… Apparently he was right though. Hindsight's 2020.”

## BAE Systems

- Borland: “ So I was required to get my wisdom teeth removed… to deploy to  Afghanistan. They cut the nerve in my face so I can't feel the right half of my face left. Half of my face is numb…  I also slipped a disc in my back, L5 S1. Long story short, I went up to med board… [and they] denied I ever had the surgery, and took me out of the Air Force. I was a 10% disabled veteran… And I had to fight the VA for over 10 years for them to even acknowledge I had the wisdom teeth removed, which is getting into things that are odd, to say the least, and what has happened to me since I saw that triangle and what has happened to me since I came into the information I came into.”
- Borland: “[After leaving the Air Force in 2013, I joined a] multi-agency special access program under BAE (British Aerospace Engineering Systems)…  BAE is the UK's version of Lockheed or Northrop Grumman, and they have an American subsidiary branch that's allowed to operate in America… Early on, [I liked the work], then things took a dramatic, insane turn… I found out I was working illegally the entire time I was there… About  seven months into working there, I found out that my clearance was revoked administratively, and I was not in any system and no one could look me up. So I was basically stuck working there indefinitely, or had to leave the IC completely.”
  - Corbell: “ Sounds like administrative terrorism, where it sounds like some sort of purgatory where you're put in a position where you're technically illegally working, which means you can't go out and get other employment, you can't leave that job.”
- Borland: “ They were notified six, seven months into it. And then from then on, they outright just did not care. They terrorized me… They were notified by multiple companies that they were not housing my clearance correctly. Multiple companies tried to pick me up… said they would give me a pay raise, a better job. I couldn't take any of it… They file complaints and I got the runaround between [BAE and] the two agencies that I work for… It is my opinion… and other people who are also whistleblowers… [that] have worked in these programs, that is a standard operating procedure… to keep this quiet.”
- Knapp: “ Your training has been in classified programs. They now tell you you don't have a clearance. You can't go to work anywhere else. You are frozen here, whether you like it or not.”
  - Borland: “ Yep. 16 hours a day doing night shift, weekends, holidays for $62,000 a year.”
  - Knapp: “ To be clear, you, you had a clearance. It's not like they said you don't have… it, they're keeping it in a purgatory, which is a technique we've heard over and over of how to keep people somewhere… and try to squeeze them out through pressure. So I just wanna make that clear. It's not like he ever had anything a mark on his record where they're like, you no longer have a clearance. He was in good standing. It, it's a, it's a type of purgatory people create.”

## Tic Tacs at Archeological Digs

- Borland: “…to do tracking of what was described at that point as ‘propane tanks.’ They had photographic evidence of archeological digs of some of these, and they had photographic evidence of ones that were complete… These are very old. They were informed they were very old… They did not disclose where they came from, which goes back to AARO and the word games that are played with AARO in this subject. But they were told, we’re trying to track these things. We’ve contacted them. We have this technology. We’re working on bringing them down.”
  - Bob Lazar, asked where the craft he saw came from: “At least one of them was part of an archeological dig, so it’s old… At least one of them is old… Not just old, it’s ancient.”
  - Lue Elizondo: “A 747 isn't uncommon to see at an international airport, but imagine being the first guy to break into King Tut's tomb, and of all the things you find in there, you find an intact 747 sitting in the tomb.”
- Corbell: “ The information you had about these flying tic-Tacs that people are taking down. Do you get that information through your work at BAE and that agency?”
  - Borland: “There were people who ended up working there with me who were brought into the legacy program, whose lives were also destroyed. And they believed… I was read into the program, and they believed that because I was having the clearance issues and the VA issues and everything else, the financial, what they did to me, they were experiencing it too… They thought it was safe to talk to me about their own experiences in the legacy program.”
- Knapp: “How do you see information that says we’ve got prehistoric archeological digs that are coming up with propane tank tic-tacs, and at the same time, we’re seeing them flying around and we need to take them down.”
  - Borland: “That was part of their briefing… The briefing to the people in the legacy program I know.”
  - Corbell: “Did you physically see photos… [and] documents?”
  - Borland: “ No, but… they were [relaying this to me] because they were genuinely concerned for their life. Because their careers were taken, their houses were broken into, computers taken, mailboxes, gone through… The agreement was that if they died, that I run with it and just blow the whole thing up.”
- Corbell: “ People directly involved with the legacy program are afraid for their lives, so they're telling you so that you can… take that information if something bad happens to them.”
  - Borland: “ it was definitely that, but it was also, this is such an isolating, lonely experience, especially for young people to be exposed to the reality of this. If… all of a sudden this pops up on your radar and you're seeing physical proof of it, you probably take a step back and go, well… So you have that aspect. Then the same people have that aspect of it and they also have the aspect of their government destroying them.”
- Knapp: “ do you know what happened to these people?”
  - Borland: “ the ones that I know still continue in the government… They continue in their classified operations programs… And… it really sucks… because I only came forward because I sincerely believed they were gonna die.”

## Quitting BAE

- Borland: “ So for three and a half years I worked for BAE without the ability to take another job. And the nature of the work we did, we would get a new boss… every six months… People were in and out of there, 'cause that job is hell. Three and a half years into it, we get a new contractor boss and he comes in and does the typical Dylan's lying. His clearance is fine. He doesn't have his master's degree. He's full of crap. And I'm like, I'm done with this, my man.”
- “So I went to my government employee… I told him… I want to know who your boss is 'cause I'm going to his office right now. Seven o'clock in the morning. I'm telling him I want my stuff fixed. He tried to tell me, don't do it. It's gonna look bad. I was like, I've been here for three and a half years. I cannot do this anymore. This work is killing me. This is insane. This is the worst place on planet Earth.”
- Borland: “I go to his boss and… say, here's my name, here's my social, look me up in [in the system that houses our clearances] 'cause I guarantee I'm not in there. And verbatim, he says to me, there's no way, you wouldn't be allowed in the building. I was like, do you wanna bet? He looks me up and he says, oh wow, you haven't had a clearance since 2014… He makes a call and he says, fix this now. I walk outta the building and magically my clearance pops up in [the system].”
- Borland: “That morning I got a phone call from BAE security, and they're not happy with what I did.”
- Borland: “I took the first job I could… and long story short, I come into work a couple weeks later and I say, here's my two week notice. I'm outta here. They're like, oh, well what can we do to keep you? I was like, there's absolutely nothing you can do to keep me.”
- Borland: “I walk outta the office, and the company that hired me, contacts me and they say, your clearance has been erased again. So I lost my clearance in May of 2018. the company that hired me, for about a month they are working… on getting my clearance fixed. And in early mid-June, I was contacted by the company that hired me and they said, we are unable to get your clearance back in the system. We have to move on to other candidates. Good luck out there. We don't think you're ever gonna get your clearance fixed.”

## Reprisals

- Borland: “That night I was invited out, and I was getting ready to sell my vehicles. I had pulled my 401k at this point 'cause I knew I was done. I had filed for unemployment, which they denied me for. And on the way home, I totaled my car and there was a police investigation. And the police had told me in confidence that my brake lines were cut. They wanted it to look like a suicide.”
- Borland: “ I had to pull my 401k 'cause I didn't have a clearance. I couldn't get a job. I almost lost my house. I had to fight BAE And the agencies I work for, for unemployment.  Basically I lost everything but my house.  The VA is denying I ever did the jobs I did denying I had the issues.”
- Borland: “I go in for a CI polygraph for a certain agency… I'm asked, what don't you wanna talk about? And I make it clear, I don't wanna talk about my IG complaint… And then he goes, what was the nature of your complaint? What are the details? And I was like, you can't ask me that… you don't have need to know”
- Borland: “ I witnessed a suicide… with other veterans… The police contacted the VA on my behalf to tell the psychologist there that this happened. I went in with another veteran… We went into our psychological eval from the suicide we both witnessed together. He was treated with due respect, asked how he felt, apologized, the whole nine. What they did to me is they accused me of faking a police report, faking being a police officer, wrote in my official medical records… that I am a liar. I am prone to delusions.”
- Borland: “ I was put into a hypnosis biofeedback program where once a week I had to go to the VA and I would be hooked up to a polygraph machine. They would flash images of an Afghan child with a gun to a butterfly, and I'm hooked up to this polygraph machine and I have to count backwards from a hundred by seven while they're flashing images. And if I got the number wrong… they start screaming at me, honking an air horn and I'd have to restart.”
- Borland: “ There was a doctor who filed a complaint within the IG at the VA on my behalf because they were, in his opinion, trying to get me to kill myself… [The VA] put me on a prescription medication for PTSD and depression… They still denied I had PTSD or depression, but they put me on the medicine for it. I woke up in the middle of the night while on this medication, and… the physical response in my brain was commit suicide.”
  - Borland: “I freaked out rightfully so. Something I will never do is commit suicide, I’m a Roman Catholic, it is against my religion to do so… And the VA psychologist, who was a CIA employee, of all things, said… oh, this is common. You need to increase your dose.”
  - Borland: “My psychiatrist… found out there was a team dedicated to me at the VA and he filed a complaint against that team. He was told that nothing's gonna change, that I answer them. He told me verbatim, he said, Dylan, you need to do everything in your power to live through this. What they're doing to you is wrong. Do not trust any of these doctors. There is something very wrong with what is being done to you.”

## JIDO

- Borland: “ [In late] 2018, I get a phone call from somebody out of CENTCOM… and he says… I heard what happened to you. What they did to you was wrong. I'm going to send you paperwork and get your clearance fixed immediately.”
  - Knapp: “That sounds like come back in, shut the hell up.”
- Borland: “At this point, I'm just trying to keep a roof over my head… He sends me a contract to deploy to Afghanistan to do security for $40,000 a year. He says, don't worry about the pay, don't worry about the job. Just sign the contract…  Three months later, he calls me up. He's like, Hey, your clearance is good to go. Everything's fine. Sorry you can't deploy to Afghanistan. Good luck, buddy.”
  - Corbell: “ So he was doing that just to get your clearance reinstated?”
  - Borland: “100%.”
- Borland: “ So from there I got hired back to JIDO (Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization). And this is 2019 and I am keeping my head down, trying to get my finances in order, keep my head down.”
- Borland: “ But I'm still paying attention. I'm paying attention to the chat, coming through work. I'm paying attention to reporting… Lue’s name’s out there, AATIP, AAWSAP. I'm looking at everybody sideways, like I don't trust anyone. 2022 rolls around and the UAPTF becomes known to me… I'm kind of participating in the forum.”
  - Borland: “I'm pulling data from the forum that I know is 100% true, and people from the legacy program. And I'm putting in little pieces myself in there to put people on the right track.”
  - Corbell: “ [Were you posting] under your name?”
  - Borland: “Yep.”

## Whistleblower

- Borland: “ In the fall of 2022. Somebody who was interviewed by the task force and claimed to be a whistleblower…  makes a declaration that the people who worked in the legacy program, their lives were in danger… I say… I can't let anybody die. That was my promise to the people I knew in the Legacy program. If they died, that I would come forward [as a whistleblower]. I don't want them to die. So I come forward and I go to Congress.”
- Borland: “[In March 2023], I get connected with the Senate… In a SCIF…  I gave them my direct knowledge of the triangle, my direct knowledge of that entire event… A legacy program in detail with technology integration, how it works, where it's at, the whole kit and caboodle… And three weeks later I get a phone call, and they said we want you to go to AARO as soon as possible.”
- Borland: “ I went to AARO…  and went through that whole process with them… I think they were quite shocked of the information I gave them… and how I could tie it to legacy programs and certain technologies and capabilities… I told 'em I wouldn't [disclose certain information they wanted] because I believed… those individuals would be targeted,  and then that became its whole issue later on when I got my classified AARO MFR (memorandum for record).”
- Borland: “ So basically, hypothetically speaking, let's say that I claim, I saw Bigfoot running around the Nevada test range and I saw Bigfoot outside the Starbucks and Bigfoot was wearing a US Air Force uniform… and I draw a nice picture of Bigfoot in a pretty Air Force uniform… If I said that to AARO and AARO comes back and says… Hey Dylan, you talking about Starbucks is unclassified. You talking about Bigfoot in that military uniform, that's Top Secret, No Foreign. You are never to say another word about that. That's what AARO did to me, and they classified everything I brought forward.”
- Borland: “I get a phone call after Dave Grusch testifies [in June], and they say, Hey Dylan, we want you to go to the ICIG… And to be honest with you, out of everything, I really feel like the IG process was the worst… The questions they asked me, the things that were said to me, made me feel like that was a fishing expedition. And the only thing they cared about was finding out how much I actually knew…  And at the end of this… it was, you are credible, not urgent. Go disappear in the winds. Leave this all behind. Shut up. Do not do anything.”
- Borland: “I was told everything I talked about in that room now is up for executive review… I talked about my childhood… I talked about unclassified information readily available on the internet. They said, Dylan, every single thing you talked about is now subject to executive review. Do not go outside of those bounds.”
- Borland: “ there's a joke amongst all the military guys, which is the Jag isn't for you. The Jag is for the DOD. The IG isn't for us. The IG is for the government. And that's the way I feel.”

## What Does This Mean?

- Borland: "I'll give my opinion. This is my opinion. Knowing what I know for a fact… Looking at history and looking at it through my perspective. I think what we are dealing with is very, very, very old. I think old humans have written those down in religious stories. I think that it's quite clear that we have been influenced by something else…  These things, whatever they are, are probably what are referred to as gods or demons or angels… Humanity has the same stories across many cultures, a flood, crafts that are in the sky, things that are coming in helping humans…  My big picture idea is it's been here for a very long time. It goes by many names. It's many different things, and it has an influence on all of us.”
