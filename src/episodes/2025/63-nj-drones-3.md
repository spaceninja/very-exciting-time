Mystery drone swarms in New Jersey and elsewhere are ongoing, triggering further FAA flight restrictions, snark from former AARO director Sean Kirkpatrick, and claims that FBI drone detection tech is inadequate. Perhaps most surprising, however, is that the Cybertruck bomber sent an email claiming to be read into a secret UAP program, and that the drones are Chinese technology, using “gravitic” propulsion!

## Continued Sightings

- Dec 29: NJ Mayor Ryan Herd Reddit AMA:
  - “I witnessed 60 drones in November, and since then on a clear night, the average seems to be 15-20.”
  - “The drones/ UAVs I have seen [are class 3 UAV]…”
  - “They look like a small plane 2 white lights underneath one red and one green light on each wing. They fly 200-400 feet above the houses in a grid like pattern. They make very little noise and sound like… small jet engines but the sound goes away quick as it passes you.”
  - “All reports go to the FBI now as they have taken over the investigation in NJ 95% are false positives and the FBI is not equipped to handle it. [Best guess] at this point out of 5000 reports, 5% are real.”
- Dec 23: NY Jets Quarterback Aaron Rodgers said a drone flew over his car: “I saw two blinking lights kinda out in the distance, and I was like ‘no fucking way.’ And then it got closer, and I rolled the window down and I peeked out, and it was like a miniature military-style drone, literally flew right over my car maybe 60-70 feet above it … I just don’t understand why they can’t tell us because the great people of New Jersey deserve to be told what’s going on.”
- Dec 7: Police report of a downed drone in NJ: “Troopers responded to a… report that there was a downed drone in the wooded area near his home… His backyard deck provided a clear view of the downed, illuminated drone. The illuminated drone appeared to be in a tree approximately one mile away… While the responding troopers prepared for a field search, [another trooper] remained on scene to maintain a visual on the drone… [We] began a methodical field search in the wooded area… Not long after the search began, [the trooper who remained behind] reported that the drone was no longer illuminated and that he was unable to observe it. NJSP Aviation responded to assist in the field search, along with JTTF, Emergency Management, Field Ops, and ERB. After approximately two hours, the search was concluded with negative results.”

## Loeb and Kirkpatrick Chime In

- Dec 14: Avi Loeb chimed in on the drones: “Over the past few days, I was asked in many interviews, text messages and emails whether the mysterious drones could be extraterrestrial in origin. In response, I explained that all available data is consistent with the flight characteristics of human-made flying objects.”
- Dec 27: Former AARO Director Sean Kirkpatrick wrote an opinion piece in Scientific American titled “The US Drone Panic Mirrors UFO Overreactions.” “The public and elected officials in Congress continue to believe lights in the sky are scary, however, particularly when they mistake crewed aircraft for drones.”
- ExoAcademian: “Remember that disinformation is not just meant to lure you in one direction over another, but to so confuse the possibility space that you become mentally/emotionally exhausted and abandon the search for truth altogether.”

## More Airport Closures and Flight Restrictions

- Dec 22: Drones forced the temporary closure of a runway at Iwakuni Kintaikyo Airport in Yamaguchi, Japan, which is a joint civilian and US Military airport.
  - “The drones entered within a no-fly zone managed by the US military, and airport office staff searched the parking lot managed by the office, but no suspicious people or drones were found. The police also investigated the area around the airport, but no suspicious people or objects were found.”
- Dec 28: The UK government placed drone restrictions over 11 military sites: “While drone legislation already covers most military sites, the new restrictions… aim to enhance deterrence and offer more legal options following a surge in drone sightings near critical facilities, particularly those linked to nuclear weapons… The authorities are continuing their investigations, although sightings have decreased significantly since late November.”
- Dec 31: The FAA expanded drone restrictions in New Jersey: “Drones are now banned from flying in parts of nine more towns, that’s in addition to dozens of towns and municipalities where the FAA issued restrictions earlier this month… It’s unclear why the new restrictions were put in place.”
  - The Daily Express: “When pressed for clarity, the FAA directed inquiries to the Department of Homeland Security, which then redirected them back to the FAA.”
- Dec 26: NJ Senator John Bramnick: “Why are you shutting down the airspace? If everything’s okay, and there’s no threat and this is just drones, and you don’t have to worry about it, we’ve got a lot of drones in the sky, why are you closing airspace?”

## NJ Mayor Ryan Herd Claims FBI Tech Inadequate

- Dec 21: NJ Mayor Ryan Herd “The administration has brought in technology that’s only capable of tracking class 1 and class 2 drones, not class 3 and class 4, these drones that we’re talking about, that we’re seeing, are large drones. They’re not your typical drone. When I say drone, you typically think about something the size of your hand. These are in no way, shape, or form, that. So it seems to me to be very convenient, they’re bringing in technology that’s not going to find an answer to this problem. They’re gonna be able to say ‘American public, don’t believe your eyes. You’re only seeing planes and stars and 1000 regular, legally operated drones.’ It’s plausible deniability.”
- Dec 22: “THREAD: The drone mystery they don’t want you to solve. Buckle up, This is going to be long… Let’s talk about what went down in NJ this month.”
  - “Wed, Dec 11: Gov Phil Murphy called a mandatory in-person meeting for NJ mayors… Reps from NJ State Police and the NJ Office of Homeland Security & Preparedness were present. The topic? Unidentified drones. They admitted they don’t know who’s flying them, where they’re launched from, where they land. I lost it. I stood up and asked ‘Can you confirm this isn’t a US military operation?’ …‘It’s not.’ ‘Can you confirm it’s not a big tech company?” ‘It’s not.’ So who is it? No answers.”
  - “Quick backstory: I’ve spent 30 years in tech—smart home, IoT, AI, ML, you name it. I know the players and the ‘skunkworks’ projects they’re hiding… On the way home, I started calling EVERYONE in drone tech and surveillance. Guess what? Nobody knew anything.”
  - “So, I assembled a team: Craig (combat vet, retired Major, drone whiz), Dr Green (combat vet, retired GS 15 tech expert), the folks at Blue Halo (cutting-edge counter-drone tech)… To confirm anything, we needed evidence—make, model, origin. And Blue Halo’s system could do it.”
  - “Fri Dec 13: I pitched the plan to Gov Murphy. The deal? Blue Halo provides tech and operators for FREE to detect, ID, and (if approved) acquire the drones. Murphy connected us with State Police Col Callahan, who set up a Zoom with the FBI.”
  - “On the FBI call: Me, Craig, Dr Green, Callahan, and an FBI special agent. We laid out the problem and the solution. The FBI said they were bringing in their own ‘assets’ to detect drones. Problem? Their tech only detects small (class 1/2) drones. We’re talking about class 3/4—totally different. The FBI ended the call abruptly.”
  - “Sat Dec 14: I attended Rep Chris Smith’s press conference… I briefed him, local mayors, and the… county sheriffs. They LOVED the plan. We also discussed involving the Coast Guard to assist with detection using Blue Halo’s tech.”
  - “Mon Dec 16: We got RED-LIGHTED. The FBI had no interest in the solution—despite it being military-grade tech, offered for FREE, with operators included.”

## Cybertruck Bomber Mentions Drones

- On New Year’s Day, a man parked a Cybertruck in front of the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas and a few seconds later, the truck exploded. Investigators determined he shot himself in the head, and found the remains of an improvised bomb in the back, made from gas cans, camp fuel canisters, and fireworks. The driver was Matthew Livelsberger, an active duty Green Beret who was stationed in Germany, but on leave in Colorado. It’s come out that he struggled with PTSD and suffered a traumatic brain injury while serving in the Middle East.
- The day before, he sent an email where he makes some claims about the nature of the mystery drones.
  - “What we have been seeing with ‘drones’ is the operational use of gravitic propulsion systems powered aircraft by most recently China in the east coast, but throughout history, the US. Only we and China have this capability. Our Operations Center location for this activity in the box is below.”
  - “China has been launching them from the Atlantic from submarines for years, but this activity recently has picked up. As of now, it is just a show of force… Because of the speed and stealth of these unmanned AC, they are the most dangerous threat to national security that has ever existed. They basically have an unlimited payload capacity and can park it over the WH if they wanted. It's checkmate… China is poised to attack anywhere in the east coast… You need to elevate this to the media so we avoid a world war because this is a mutually assured destruction situation.”
  - “USG needs to give the history of this, how we are employing it and weaponizing it, how China is employing them and what the way forward is… I have knowledge of this program… I have an active TSSCI with UAP USAP access.”
    - CBS: “Livelsberger had… a new assignment involving drones that friends said excited him.”
  - Post Disclosure World: “Regarding this alleged manifesto… He blew himself up in a car, thus I'll take his claims with a grain of salt.”
  - Joe Murgia: “An unwell man [blows up] a Tesla Cybertruck… in front of Trump hotel… and people are going crazy because he left a note behind referencing drones, UAP and antigravity? Seriously? Is there ANY evidence to back up his claims?”
