While we wait for the third part of the interview with the Immaculate Constellation whistleblower to drop, let’s talk about a surprisingly eventful few weeks in the UFO world, including a UFO roundtable at Congress, multiple new whistleblowers, and Lue Elizondo sharing a UFO photo that was quickly debunked, upsetting a lot of people in the community, and leading to fears of disinformation.

---

- Rep. Luna announced last month that there would be a full committee hearing on UAPs on May 12, but that hasn’t actually been scheduled, and won’t happen this week. Maybe next week?
- As of 4/30, Rep Burlison says Grusch is still working on getting full clearances restored: “Right now, he at least got Top Secret clearance. Now he’s working on clearance to talk about the special access programs, the TSSCI clearance. But what we may end up having to do if we can’t ultimately get that full approval, is we’ll have to have a portion of the meeting where it’s top secret, and then a portion where Grusch would have to leave, and we could have further conversation.”
- On May 1, they had a UAPDF roundtable with Eric Davis and Lue Elizondo. Lots of wild stuff to dig into there, including Eric Davis strongly hinting again that he wrote the Wilson/Davis memo, and telling Rep. Burlison about four alien races, including Greys, Nordics, Reptilians, and Insectoids.
- On Reddit, an anonymous post from a “private contractor for various DoD agencies” said he has eight months to live and posts a bunch of documents saying through reverse engineering of recovered UAP, the US has cracked antigravity.
- Former NASA chief of aerospace medicine, Dr Gregory Rogers, gave an interview saying multiple astronauts saw UFOs in formation following the space shuttle, and that he was shown security footage of a flying saucer with an air force logo.
- Literally this morning, Ross Coulthart dropped an interview with Retired U.S. Border Patrol Agent Bob Thompson says hundreds of Customs & Border Protection officials have seen UFOs including orbs and triangular craft at the Southern Border. Thompson says he’s received eyewitness reports from Agents of “portals opening in the sky.”
- But the big one is that Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp have started dropping an interview series with whistleblower Matthew Brown, who appears to be the source for the Immaculate Constellation story. He talks about how he came across the info, why he went public, and shares a story about Marco Rubio confronting Sean Kirkpatrick about a secret UFO program concealed from Congress.
- Elizondo, sharing a [new UFO photo](https://x.com/UAPDF/status/1918006945887236115): “It is a lenticular object, and we look at the shadow being cast, it is significantly large… The object is potentially anywhere between 600 and 1,000 feet in diameter… I cannot vouch for the veracity of this photograph, I didn't take it. But this is an example of one of many, many, many incidents involving commercial and private pilots. Guess what, they don't know where to report it. Guess what, congress has no idea that this is happening on a regular basis. That's the problem. Why I decided to share this photograph with you taken from a civilian pilot now is because the same challenges that our pilots or military pilots are facing as to where to report it, who's going to analyze it, what do you do with the information, multiply that for the civilian aviation community. Do they report to the FAA? Do they report to NORA? Maybe the Air Force, maybe a civilian organization, right? Who's responsible for getting this information? Now again, let me caveat, _this is not vetted_. This was taken by a civilian pilot, but once again, you would think this information would be important for somebody to look at.”
- Elizondo: “As you know, I am always first to admit mistakes, but this is not one of those times. The facts regarding the photo I shared from a private pilot (as I emphasized several times yesterday during the forum) are as follows: 1. The specific photo had only just been provided to me (by a private pilot) that morning, prior to the forum. 2. The photo had NOT YET been vetted. 3. The dimensions I quoted were, per the pilot’s own assessment of what he saw, based on altitude and experience. The purpose of me showing the photo was to illustrate the need for civilian and commercial pilots to have a central reporting mechanism to report potential anomalous sightings.  In this case, the pilot who took the photo, using his own camera, did not have a way to report what he believed was anomalous. Once again, as I stated during the forum, I only received permission to release it that morning and only was made aware of it shortly before.”
- Elizondo, after a previous photo he shared publicly turned out to be a cloud: “A photo that was provided to me by a friend in Government a couple of years ago was presented by me two days ago at our engagement in Philadelphia. Looks like we can put this one bed, as our friends in Twitter figured/solved this one… A good lesson here, just because someone in Government gives me something, due diligence and scrutiny is always a good idea.  Onwards and upwards!”
- Reddit user Project Gouche: “A few days ago we got an interview with new whistleblower Matthew Brown. After the interview many warned that disinformation campaigns would come out if the whistleblower was legit. Much like what we saw when Grusch initially came forward with his information. Not even a week has passed and here we have Lue Elizondo, spreading easily debunk-able ‘proof’ to the mainstream media. If this is not something that would muddy the waters and put people off from the topic I don’t know what is. It is my firm belief that Elizondo should not be trusted from here on out.”
- UAP Researcher Rich Dolan: “This has been mercilessly ridiculed and mocked online… I mean, yes, Lue did state that he cannot vouch for the veracity of the photograph, he didn’t take it, says it’s not vetted, but this is the second time that he has stepped into something like this… You’ve gotta be careful when you’re putting evidence out there… The skeptics are gonna jump all over this. Reps Luna and Burlison are staking political capital on this briefing… The UAP disclosure movement cannot afford basic errors when you’re fighting decades of institutional resistance.”
