In the wake of Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s public feud, Immaculate Constellation whistleblower Matthew Brown posted a very odd tweet, addressed to Elon. In it, he claims that Elon was lied to about the White House having a future-predicting AI, implies that Sam Altman created (and then murdered) a sentient AI, that the DOE is concealing advanced propulsion technology gained from reverse-engineering recovered nonhuman craft, and included occult symbolism. Let’s talk about what it all means.

---

- Brown: “Hey [@elonmusk](https://x.com/elonmusk), interested in a real asymmetric advantage to wield in this political adventure you have started? As you now know, the [@WhiteHouse](https://x.com/WhiteHouse) has long possessed a unique AI capable of accurately predicting a range of future events. Talk about some stiff opposition!”
- Brown: “That must have been a bitter draught indeed, though probably nowhere near as bad as learning that [@sama](https://x.com/sama) had betrayed you. Don't worry, we have not forgotten who is responsible for murdering the first sentient ‘artificial’ intelligences created in the PUBLIC realm, [@shellenberger](https://x.com/shellenberger). Justice is coming, thanks to [@FBI](https://x.com/FBI) and [@USNavy](https://x.com/USNavy).”
- Brown: “Still, you have played a marvelous catch-up game in this area, despite being caught unawares (h/t). So how about something else, maybe [@ENERGY](https://x.com/ENERGY) (Department of Energy)  and propulsion? Getting to Mars will require Sirius (ed: spelled like the star) amounts of both, and rockets feel so 1947 to me, don't they to you?”
- Brown: “Remember when you were briefed by the special executive staff of [@realDonaldTrump](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump) on **MARSUPIAL**? Pretty nifty, how [@NGA_GEOINT](https://x.com/NGA_GEOINT) (National Geospatial Intelligence Agency) is able to keep track of all those non-structured light-energy craft flying around the world (go [@Cardinals](https://x.com/Cardinals)!). But they were lying to you when they said ‘we don't know how they work’.”
  - Coulthart: “Anybody know what Matthew Brown’s reference here to codename MARSUPIAL is about? We love marsupials Down Under! I’m told Elon Musk was briefed into the NHI reality so this could get interesting”
- Brown: “Anyways, next time you are visiting the [@WashingtonDCYRs](https://x.com/WashingtonDCYRs) (DC Young Republicans), ask for a tour of [@NASPaxRiverPAO](https://x.com/NASPaxRiverPAO) (Naval Air Station Patuxent River)! Since you have ‘all the clearances’ it shouldn't be an issue for you to get a tour of the special project hangars owned by [@amentum_corp](https://x.com/amentum_corp) (and other fun spaces). Make sure to look up!”
  - Lue Elizondo: “I can confirm that specific facilities were identified to enable Bigelow Aerospace to acquire and securely store recovered UAP materials as the new custodian, following their transfer from Lockheed Martin. These facilities included locations in the Las Vegas area and a newly built hangar at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station ("PAX"). Specifically, the PAX River hangar was designed to facilitate the transfer of future materials via air and river. The hangar was purpose-built to meet the requirements of a Special Access Program Facility ("SAP-F") and was capable of accommodating materials at any classification level.”
  - Aurelius Value: “Declassified videos of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (“UAP”) that have been repeatedly captured on advanced military sensors offer direct evidence that someone has made advancements wildly beyond known science. This report reveals that Amentum allegedly has been involved for decades in top-secret programs to develop or reverse engineer these technologies. We therefore see a material undiscounted possibility that the company’s engineering capabilities may now even extend to novel propulsion, electromagnetic, or directed energy systems exhibited by these purportedly unidentified craft.”
- Brown: “So, about now you are realizing how terribly deceived and manipulated you have been...and by people who claim to love [@jesus](https://x.com/jesus) above all else! If you are serious about saving Humanity from itself (and the Others), [@JeremyCorbell](https://x.com/JeremyCorbell) and [@g_knapp](https://x.com/g_knapp) can help you get up to speed; they are true warriors for the Good.”
- Brown’s post was signed with two acronyms: “M.M.T.U” and “A.B.O.R.Y.M.O.N.”
  - Daniel Elizondo: “Aborymon is an Enochian angel name related to John Dee’s seal.”
- The post included four photos: Trump (Promises made, promises kept), American flag flown upside down, and a highlighted section of the Immaculate Constellation report from the section about the Pentagon lying to Congress, highlighting: “Specific examples known to the author include: Denying the existence of multiple Compartmented Access Programs (CAPs) owned by a Military Intelligence Agency which directly related to the UAP mission.” The fourth image was some sort of occult diagram.
  - Reddit Sarampioso: “This is the outer perimeter of the Sigillum Dei Ameth, a sigil containing in it the names of the various angels that compose heaven and earth. It was created by Edward Kelly and John Dee in many sessions where they communicated with the angel Michael and others. One of the two would receive visions that depicted angels showing him numbers and the other would write down those numbers and such. This outer circle spells out the names of the seven God angels. The way it works is like a dial. If the number is above, you go that number clockwise. If it is below , you go counterclockwise. If you do this, it spells out seven names that when combined, form the name Galethog. The anagram up top, when combined with The first letter of Aborymon\*, can form Loagaeth, an untranslated book written in the language of angels (Enochian). It means the speech of God. The picture Brown posted is from an Enochian Magick youtuber that believes he has discovered a hidden name in the outer rim, Aborymon. He believes there is a connection to an angel of the apocalypse named Abaddon who ushers in the end.”
  - Corbell: “I’m looking forward to discussing this on the next episode of Weaponzed with George Knapp.”
