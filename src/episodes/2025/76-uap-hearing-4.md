Recently, Congress held another UAP hearing! This one was primarily focused on the need to protect whistleblowers from reprisals. We were shown an unusual video of a missile appearing to bounce off a UAP, and we heard from three new military witnesses, including our first active-duty witness. Plus, legendary journalist George Knapp brought the receipts, naming names involved in the now-famous attempted transfer of UAP material from Lockheed Martin to BASS, which was shut down by the CIA, as well as a huge pile of UAP paperwork he smuggled out of Soviet-era Russia!

- Rep Anna Paulina Luna: "We had tried to get another hearing with the Task Force before this one, and every single witness we had reached out to said that they didn't want to testify because they were scared for their life. And these were not people that you see in the media. These were not podcasters or anyone who's made a career talking about it. These were legitimate former military or military contractors, and they were, literally, afraid of being killed.”
  - Luna: “And then you had David Grusch tell us directly that he… felt in fear of his life. And… even just yesterday I actually went into the SCIF with David Grusch and Rep Burlison, and… there was something really bizarre that took place with David Grusch, and it's being handled at the law-enforcement level. But things like that happening are not normal, especially being that David Grusch is currently Eric Burlison's congressional staffer.”
  - Luna: “Something happened as he was driving in… Law enforcement is involved… and if you are going to brandish any weapons at Congressional staffers, it’s very alarming… It was very interesting in timing, and based on what we’ve heard previously from witnesses… this is not the first case of this.”

## Kirkpatrick Drama

- Former AARO Dir Sean Kirkpatrick: “If Luna and her ‘Lunatics’ want to continue to parade charlatans and grifters in front of an audience to satisfy her need for playhouse politics, then the American people should demand accountability of all the wasted taxpayer money and Congressional time she has derailed from more serious issues facing this country… It’s a disgrace to the Congress and the U.S. government and only serves to provide reality TV.”
- Rep Luna: “Kirkpatrick is an irrelevant little man who is a known documented liar, has blocked the release of information, and tried to discredit witnesses… It seems to me that he’s suffering more from small man complex and sometime his BIG emotions get the best of him… We will continue to pray for the recovery of Mr. Kirkpatrick and his tiny ego and his journey to deal with his mental health.”

## Luna’s Opening Statement

- Rep Luna: “Congress tried to create formal channels through the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, also known as AARO, and the Intelligence Community Inspector General for service members and officials to make disclosures. But the reality, the reports come in are often too brushed aside, slow-walked or met with skepticism rather than serious investigation. Recently, the former AARO director, known as Sean Kirkpatrick, attacked our witnesses and members on this committee. It should be noted that he's a documented liar and brings into question what his purpose at AARO really was if it was not to follow up on investigations and disclose his findings to members of Congress.”
  - Later: “I'd be happy to send maybe a subpoena to Mr. Kirkpatrick.”
- Rep Luna: “The witnesses today are not alone. In fact, they're far from it. In fact, 34 senior military government and intelligence officials have broken their silence. This includes now-Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, Senator Rounds, Senator Gillibrand, General Jim Clapper, the former director of the government's UAP task force, the former Head of Aviation Security for the White House National Security Council, the former Secretary of Defense, and many more. Again to quote Secretary of State Rubio in an upcoming documentary, known as The Age of Disclosure, "Even presidents have been operating on a need-to-know basis that begins to spin out of control." And to quote Senator Gillibrand, who also went public in this documentary, "It's not acceptable to have secret parts of this government that no one ever sees." It's time for the fundamental truths of UAP to be revealed to our nations, leaders and the public.”

## Hellfire Missile Video

- [Video](https://x.com/RepEricBurlison/status/1965438792493355291): The object rotates before impact, 3 orbs seem to emerge from and continue to follow the main object following impact, and the main object appears to regain it's original shape.
- Knapp: “That's a Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO and just bounced right off, and it kept going.”
- Former fighter pilot Ryan Bodemheimer: “The Hellfire's laser guidance is surgical. It doesn't miss. This was a clean shot, and the UAP just didn't give a damn. And it looks like it's not a glitch in the Hellfire missile either. This is just something that we haven't ever seen before.”
- Former AATIP Director Lue Elizondo: "This video does require more analysis. And if it turns out that this is something that is a hard object, something tangible, if would be very, very unusual, if not...or dare I say, almost impossible for a Hellfire missile to strike it and not completely destroy it or obliterate it."
- Burlison: “I received it anonymously, in a way that I’ve learned is called a ‘dead-drop’. The video was scrubbed of all information. Completely anonymous. There’s nothing to trace it back, and I have no idea who gave it to me… I don’t have the resources to do forensic on videos… I could sit on it, but I’m a disclosure guy. I’m just gonna let the internet figure out the validity of this video.”
- Murgia: “The evidence is most consistent with a slow-moving or stationary balloon carrying an electrical payload, struck by a Hellfire that failed to detonate.”
- Anonymous British army ammo tech, trained in Hellfire missiles: “"It follows a very guided trajectory. When that missile comes in, all it cares about is punching into that target and then exploding. The reason why it didn't explode is, unfortunately, quite boring. It didn't have enough force on impact, which tells you that the object is extremely soft, light and basically didn't overcome the safety mechanism. Which is, it has to hit a certain deceleration… to prime the fuse and detonate the warhead. So all that tells me is the target is extremely soft or light.”
- Missileman (bio: materials science, physics, aerospace, defense): “I showed the video… to engineering physicists & weapon designers (not warfighters, and not Hellfire designers). Consensus opinion so far is two fold: 1. There’s not enough data from the output screen to make a definitive conclusion, velocity data of threat before/after collision is extremely important… 2. The events on screen are not inconsistent with a glancing impact of an air-to-air Hellfire against a small drone or balloon… There will be a lot of arguing… but frankly not sure we can learn anything more from existing video. Need more data.”
- Former Navy pilot Ryan Graves: “After further review, it’s conceivable the video is of a prosaic target struck by a missile, chunks broke off, stabilized in the airstream, and began a parabolic descent that is generally aligned with the camera angle, making the target aspect change nearly imperceptible as it descends… Without source details, I can’t say more.”
  - Graves: “Rep Burlison, I am aware of much longer videos with clearly anomalous behaviors captured by the same MQ-9 platform in other parts of the world. The witness is willing to come forward and the videos are accessible through the proper channels.”

## Wiggins

- Wiggins: “I am Alexandro Wiggins, an active-duty U.S. Navy Operations Specialist Senior Chief Petty Officer with approximately 23 years of service… On the evening of February 15th, 2023… off the coast of Southern California, I was serving on board USS Jackson. During that period, I moved between the interior communication center, ICC-1, and the bridge wing, correlating the sensor picture with visual observations, part of my routine responsibilities for surface and air picture management. What I observed and what our crew recorded was not consistent with conventional aircraft or drones as they appear on our system.”
- Wiggins: “A self-luminous Tic Tac-shaped object emerged from the ocean before linking up with three other similar objects. The four then disappeared simultaneously, with a high synchronized, near instantaneous acceleration. I observed no sonic boom and no conventional propulsion signatures, no exhaust plume, no control surface articulation on the Sapphire image system. Shortly after the synchronized departure, radar tracks dropped. These observations were multi-sensor and recorded inside of ICC-1, with time location overlay visible in our source frames that have been made public by journalists.”
- Wiggins: “To be clear, I'm not here to make claims beyond my lane. I'm here to provide a first-hand account of what I saw, what our systems recorded, and why it matters for safety, for intelligence and public confidence. My request to you is practical, help us capture, protect, fairly evaluate the evidence, and provide a safe pathway for those in uniform to report it.”

## Nuccetelli

- Nuccetelli: “My name is Jeffrey Nuccetelli. I am a former military police officer with sixteen years of active duty service in the United States Air Force. Between 2003 and 2005, five UAP incidents occurred at Vandenberg Air Force Base, home to the National Missile Defense Project, a top national security priority. At the time, we were conducting launches deemed by the National Reconnaissance Office as “the most important in twenty-five years.” These facilities were vital — and they were repeatedly visited by UAP. Each incident was witnessed by multiple personnel, documented, investigated, and reported up the chain of command. We sent information up, but no guidance came down.”
- Nuccetelli: “The incursions began on October 14, 2003, when Boeing contractors reported a massive, glowing red square silently hovering over two missile defense sites. After several minutes, it drifted east and vanished behind the hills. This event — now known as the Vandenberg Red Square — was later referenced by Representative Luna during the first public hearing on this topic. Official Air Force records documenting it are now held by AARO and the FBI. Later that night, while I was on duty, security guards at a critical launch site reported a bright, fast-moving object. As I responded, the radio erupted with panic: “It’s coming right at us… now it’s right here!” Moments later: “It took off — it’s gone!” When I arrived, five shaken witnesses described a massive rectangular craft, larger than a football field, that hovered silently for about 45 seconds before shooting away at incredible speed.”
- Nuccetelli: “About a week later, another patrol reported a strange light over the ocean, heading toward the Base. Believing it to be an unannounced aircraft, they declared an emergency and launched an armed response. Before forces arrived, the object descended, hovered briefly or landed, then vanished instantly into the night sky. The witness was later threatened and told to kept quiet about the incident, discouraging further reports.”
- Nuccetelli: “And after that, things stayed quiet until 2005, when a patrol reported a massive triangular craft, larger than a C-130, hovering low over the main base. It drifted silently across the installation before disappearing into the night.”
- Rep Lauren Boebert: “Has AARO ever followed up with you about the Red Square event?”
  - Nuccetelli: “They let me know that they were unable to locate any records, that the records had been destroyed by the Air Force. The Air Force is destroying all their police records every three years on a schedule.”
- Rep Scott Perry: “if this were sanctioned by the US government… do you see any reason why they would allow you access being present, viewing it, hearing it, being around it? Is this an accident? Like does the US government make these kind of… mistakes like this where, we're doing this test of this new system and we forgot these guys were standing here. Does that sound like something that the US government would do?”
  - Nuccetelli: “No, sir. Some of the launches we were doing were like $5 billion projects that had taken like 10 years to develop the technology, and these objects were coming right up to the launchpad. So any kind of mistake, I mean, it could cause a catastrophe… For that particular launch, we had 500 Air Force police officers guarding the launch. 500 people. It was that critical.”

## Borland

- Borland: “My name is Dylan Borland, a former 1N1 Geospatial Intelligence Specialist for the United States Air Force and in active duty in listed capacity from 2010 to 2013. I'm a federal whistleblower having testified to both the ICIG and AARO with direct firsthand knowledge of and experience with craft and technologies that are not ours and are reportedly operating without congressional oversight. Because of my direct knowledge of the reality of certain legacy UAP programs, my professional career was deliberately obstructed and I have endured sustained reprisals from government agencies for over a decade.”
- Borland: “During the summer of 2012, my team was on standby for weather and I returned to my barracks on base and at approximately 01:30 I saw an approximately 100 foot equilateral triangle take off from near the NASA hangar on the base… [It flew toward me], stopped about 100 feet in front of me and approximately 100 feet above me. My telephone got extremely hot, completely froze dead… It was between one to two stories thick, equilateral triangle… There were four lights in total, one light on each corner and a larger light in the center, two to three times the size of the corner lights. But what was really odd was the outside… the craft itself was this black metallic flake paint, but on top of the craft was this gold, lava plasma, some type of fluid going over and around the craft… I was under this triangular craft for [2-3] minutes and then it rapidly ascended to commercial jet level in seconds displaying zero kinetic disturbance, sound, or wind displacement.”
- Borland: “Some years after that experience, I was further exposed to classified information from the UAP Legacy Crash Retrieval programs through a sensitive position I held within a special access program. During this time, intelligence officers approached me in fear for their own careers, citing misconduct within these programs and similar retaliation that I was already enduring at this time.”
- Borland: “These issues include medical malpractice committed by Veterans Affairs staff, denial of work I performed while enlisted in the United States Air Force, forged and manipulated employment documents, workplace harassment, including colleagues being directed to not speak with me, manipulation of my security clearance by certain agencies blocking, delaying, and ultimately removing my ability to be employed within the IC.”
- Borland: “Since my ICIG complaint, I've been prevented from assuming prior employment and can confirm I'm still blacklisted from certain agencies within the intelligence community. In addition, multiple agencies attempted phishing attacks to assess what I had divulged to the Inspector General, including being asked to disclose details of my ICIG complaint during a CI polygraph or a position unrelated to UFO UAP matters as recently as November, 2024.”
- Rep Eric Burlison: “In the classified realm, have you been exposed to undeniable confirmation of NHI technology?”
  - Borland: “Yeah, we're going to have to have a conversation in SCIF for that, whether I'm legally even allowed to answer that and whether you're even allowed to hear it, sir.”
- Borland: “The statement AARO has made is ‘no scientific evidence of extraterrestrials.’ Scientific evidence requires a scientific control. Extraterrestrial is an entity on another planet. The only way to scientifically prove extraterrestrial is we have to go to that planet, acquire technology, bring it back and compare it to what we have here… And by that statement, AARO found no scientific evidence of extraterrestrials is basically, I don't want to call it a psyop, but a misrepresentation because we do have things. But making that statement is not technically a lie. It's a misrepresentation of the full truth.”
  - DoD spokesperson Susan Gough: “I can confirm that, to date, the Department of Defense has not found any verifiable evidence that any UAP incident is a result of extraterrestrial activity.”
    - UAP researcher Kyle Warfel emailed her in June of this year asking if he could amend her statement to “include non-human intelligence and unknown intelligence in addition to extraterrestrial.”
    - Gough replied “No you may not amend my statement.”
    - Confusingly, in the past, Gough has confirmed that their definition of extraterrestrial does include non-human intelligence and origin. 🤷
    - Gough: “For DoD, the term extraterrestrial encompasses anything that is not terrestrial (e.g., Earth) in origin.”

## Knapp

- “I'm George Knapp, chief investigative reporter at KLAS-TV in Las Vegas. I began my pursuit of this weird mystery way back in 1987, and for 38 years, I've always approached this as a news story. It's not a matter of faith or belief to me, it's a story and it's an important one. I want to share a couple of things that I've learned along the way on this long journey, and I submitted most of that in written form, because I estimate that my statement here today would take about four and a half hours, so I'm going to try to jump over and touch on the more important, salient points.”
- Knapp: “What got me hooked is the paper trail, documents that were squeezed out of the US government after the FOIA, Freedom of Information Act, became the law of the land, and those documents paint a much different picture than what the public, the press and Congress have been told over many years. The documents from military and intelligence personnel behind closed doors admit that, quote, "These things are real. They're not fictitious. They can fly in formation, they're evasive, and they outperform any aircraft known to exist, including ours." The public, of course, as I said, has been told something much different.”
- Knapp: “The one name I do want to bring up in this session though is Robert Bigelow. So looking into the idea of crash retrievals and reverse engineering while AAWSAP that program was active, the DIA's contractor, Robert Bigelow of Las Vegas made a bold attempt to acquire physical proof of UFO crashes. It's been widely reported and suspected that Lockheed Martin is one of the contractors, the defense contractors that has held this stuff, stored it away in secrecy and tried to figure out how it works. I have confirmed on the record that Robert Bigelow and a trusted colleague from AAWSAP met with and negotiated with senior executives at Lockheed Martin and hammered out a deal wherein Bigelow's company would receive a quantity of unusual material that had been stashed away and protected at a facility in California. That material was not made here.”
- Knapp: “I want to move on now to the Russia files because that was going to be the central impetus of what I was going to talk to you about today. Back in the early '90s, I got into Russia, met with a number of their defense officials, Ministry of Defense, and others who confirmed for me that Russia had been doing the same thing that the United States had been doing. That is secretly studying UFOs while publicly saying something completely different. The documents and interviews that I obtained and have now shared with this task force show that the USSR launched what is almost certainly the largest UFO UAP investigation in the world.”
  - Rep Burlison: “This is a huge file!” (Holding up what looks to be about half a ream of paper held together with a binder clip)
  - Doesn’t appear to be public (yet?)
- Knapp: “The first phase of that was an order was sent out to the entire USSR military empire that every unit, you see anything strange in the sky, a craft, an orb, something unusual, you had to gather all the evidence, collect testimony from the witnesses, look for physical evidence, and all of that information went into one program at the Ministry of Defense. Thousands and thousands of these reports came in. A lot of them were first routed to the KGB, but then back to another program that came after this collection effort called Thread Three. And Thread Three was an analysis program we provided to the committee the documents of what they were trying to do and essentially they were trying to build their own UFOs. They were using the information from their observations and studies to try to figure out that technology. The guy who was in charge of that program, Colonel Boris Sokolov, told me that their goal was to basically develop technology that would be superior to anything we had based on what they learned from UFOs.”
  - And then they cut him off for time!
- Rep Tim Burchett: “How did you manage to obtain the classified Russian UAP documents and how did you get them back in the United States?”
  - Knapp: “I did something kind of dumb. I met with these officials who during that time period, Glasnost, Perestroika, the Russians were trying to open up to the world, and I saw it as a window of opportunity, and it was. And we were able to talk these folks into providing us information that otherwise we would never have seen some of that was classified. I found out that they only stamped the top pages of these documents that were classified, so I just removed them. I removed those pages and I carried them out. And if they'd caught me, I'd be in a gulag still.”
- Rep Luna: “How do we know that the [Russian] files you obtained… are not BS and just given to you as a disinformation campaign against the US government?”
  - Knapp: “That’s a good question. So I shared some of them with the Senate Intelligence Committee when I first got back because that was requested by the Russians who shared some of that information with me. Secondly, I gave all of that material to the DIA, through Robert Bigelow at BASS, and Jim Lakatski at the AWWSAP program… They hired a whole team to go through them and retranslate them and analyze it, then they created a structure of how the UFO programs in the USSR, in Russia were put together. They said they were real. The other person who said they are real is David Grusch.”
  - Rep Burlison: “To me, the validity of this document is underscored by the fact that Russia would not want this to be known. They absolutely would not want the public to know, or the United States to know that there was a vulnerability in their missile systems.”
- Rep Nick Begich: “Are you willing to name specific gatekeepers within the root cell of the UAP-SAP federation?”
  - Knapp: “Well, one of them was named Dr. James Ryder at Lockheed.”
  - Knapp: “But again, to emphasize, I don't fault these contractors for doing what they were asked to do by our government. They're supposed to lie if people ask about it. And the intelligence agencies who gave this stuff to them, CIA think primarily, told them to keep it quiet. And they've done that, and I suspect that they'd like an off-ramp, that they'd like some help with figuring out this technology at some point.”
  - Knapp: “[Another] name for you: Glenn Gaffney, CIA.”
  - Liberation Times: “Multiple sources claimed that these material transfer efforts were blocked by former CIA Director of Science and Technology, Glenn Gaffney, when he held the position. Gaffney’s alleged interference in the material transfer left those involved—including the now-deceased James Ryder, former Vice President of Lockheed Martin Space Systems, who is said to have led efforts within Lockheed Martin—feeling threatened due to the harshness of exchanges with CIA officials. Ultimately, Liberation Times understands that the transfer was blocked by Gaffney, as the CIA’s Directorate of Technology remains the original custodian of the alleged non-human materials, which Lockheed Martin may still possess to this day.”
