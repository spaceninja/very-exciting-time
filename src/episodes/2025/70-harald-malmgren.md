Harald Malmgren was an advisor to multiple US presidents, including JFK, and involved in numerous historic incidents, including in the war room during the Cuban missile crisis. Days before he died, he gave a final interview to Jesse Michels, exploring his interactions with the UAP topic throughout his life. He makes several interesting claims, including that he saw footage of a UFO being brought down during a nuclear test, held UAP debris in Los Alamos, and was briefed on UAP crash recoveries by CIA deputy director Richard Bissell.

- Jason Dziak, of Signal Theory, wrote: “His story also blurs lines. Malmgren doesn’t always separate what he directly experienced, what he was briefed on, and what he came to believe. The result is a narrative that requires careful parsing. One that holds potential insight, but also ambiguity. Did he witness the extraordinary? Was he relaying whispers from behind closed doors? Or did belief fill in the blanks left by a lifetime of proximity to secrets?”
- Dziak: “In that interview, Malmgren stated that he had directly handled debris from a UFO shot down during Operation Dominic’s Bluegill Triple Prime nuclear test in 1962. He was briefed by CIA Deputy Director of Plans Richard Bissell, founder of Area 51, on recovered craft and technologies not of human origin. And he claimed that concepts for directed-energy weapons used in the Strategic Defense Initiative ("Star Wars") were seeded by knowledge obtained from a surviving being recovered at the Roswell crash in 1947.”

## Earth-Shattering Revelations

- Jesse Michels: “It should make everyone question their reality when this man, at the end of his life and before tragically passing, felt compelled to pass on what he learned to humanity: earth-shattering revelations. He claimed these things in a four hour interview:”
  - “He held UFO (or UAP) material directly. This material came out of the plume of a nuclear test called Bluegill Triple Prime conducted at Johnston Atoll in the Marshall Islands in 1962. It was handed to him by Lawrence Preston Gise, director of the Albuquerque branch of the Atomic Energy Commission (who happens to be Jeff Bezos’ grandfather).”
  - “The Deputy Director of Plans for the CIA and the man who built and designed Area51, Richard Bissell, briefed Malmgren on “otherworld technologies”. This includes past crash retrievals like the Magenta crash in Lombardy, Italy in 1933 along with broader awareness of UFO appearances around tip of the spear technology development at sensitive Department of Energy sites across the country.”
  - “He told his daughter Pippa off air in his final hours that there had been UFO crash survivors (biologics) and he was shown a video of the “sole surviving extraterrestrial being” from Roswell.“
  - “Malmgren says point blank that he believes JFK knew about UFOs long before becoming president (from his history in Naval Intelligence). He and LBJ raced out to Los Alamos right after Blugill Triple Prime to be briefed in person. He says that JFK’s desire to collaborate with the Soviets on UFOs, space exploration and denuclearization were core parts of the impetus to assassinate him.”
  - “Malmgren discusses the “Majestic” - the group who took it upon themselves to “protect” the world. They tracked him from a young age, he says. This is the first time anyone of this caliber has mentioned this name which is mostly associated with document leaks in the 80’s and 90’s that outline an “elite of the elite” military, intelligence and scientific group governing the UFO issue.”

## Firsthand Claims

- Saw uncensored footage of Bluegill Triple Prime “tagalong”: “He reviewed a classified film and accompanying report shared with President Kennedy that showed the unidentified object following the missile and then tumbling from the sky following detonation.”
  - “The object was unidentified, clearly not Soviet, and not addressed in the official after-action brief.”
  - Echoes claims of Robert Jacobs, who recorded a disc-shaped craft flying circles around an Atlas rocket test in 1964, and fired beams of light at it.
- Denied access despite Q-clearance: “Despite possessing full Q-clearance and top-secret authorization, Malmgren was explicitly denied access to additional details about the recovered object.”
  - “Naval Intelligence retained sole jurisdiction, and Malmgren noted they operated outside even CIA oversight.”
  - Q-clearance is the DOE equivalent of DOD’s Top Secret clearance.
- Handled UFO material: “Malmgren claimed he personally handled physical debris recovered from a “tagalong” object knocked down by a high-altitude X-ray burst during the Bluegill Triple Prime nuclear test. The object had followed an ICBM-like test missile before being disrupted and recovered by Naval Intelligence.”
  - “He described the material as heavy, strangely inert, and mentally “communicative”—a sensation echoed in other experiencer accounts.”
  - Malmgren: “These are things that have come down… Debris. Round rocks… If you didn’t know how it was retrieved… ‘Put this stuff in your hands, play with it, see what it feels like.’ …It felt weird, because it didn’t feel like anything that we know… The color of something in space… Depends on the light in the room… They were heavy…”
  - Michels: “When he was holding the UFO pieces, they seemed to telepathically communicate with him. He heard words in his head. He forgot the exact words but he felt they were important and that the material may have implanted ideas in his subconscious. He also apparently thought that this was a test that Gise had given him, to see if he would have this mental reaction to the pieces."
- Briefed by CIA: “Richard Bissell, the CIA’s Deputy Director of Plans and key architect of both the U-2 program and Area 51, provided Malmgren with detailed background on UAP phenomena, recovery programs, and the secrecy architecture involved.”
  - “Bissell confirmed the phenomenon was real, global in scope, and a threat to centralized control within U.S. intelligence.”

## Secondhand Claims

- Naval Intelligence recovered the tagalong: “The “tagalong” object was recovered by the Navy and brought to Los Alamos. Malmgren was shown samples by Lawrence “Larry” Gees, who oversaw the test program under the Atomic Energy Commission.”
  - “The Navy’s secrecy was described as more rigid and isolated than the CIA’s. The recovered debris was used as a diagnostic tool—possibly even a test of psychic or cognitive resonance.”
- 1933 Magenta UFO Crash: “Bissell confirmed that the Vatican and Mussolini’s fascist regime had recovered a craft in 1933, which was later transferred to U.S. custody with the help of Allen Dulles.”
  - “This corroborates recent claims by David Grusch and aligns with Vatican archives and reports of involvement from Pope Pius XII.”
- Roswell survivor and directed energy weapons: “According to Bissell, one of the beings recovered at the Roswell crash had communicated knowledge to U.S. officials, including concepts that later informed the design of X-ray-based interception systems and the Star Wars program.”
  - “Malmgren claimed these systems were not just for nuclear defense but were intended for UAP engagement.”
- Psychic UFO Debris: “He believed his contact with the material was orchestrated to see if he would respond with telepathic impressions. According to Malmgren, Lawrence Gees hinted that others had experienced similar effects.”

## Speculation

- JFK knew about, perhaps was killed over, UFOs
- UFOs use quantum navigation and nuclear energy
- Star Wars Programs was a UFO containment system
- NHI monitoring/influencing “tip of the spear” technology developments
- MJ12 (or others) monitoring and grooming young people
- Knights of Malta stuff

## Recap

- Malmgren says he saw footage of UFO interacting with and brought down during nuke test.
- Shown purported debris and told Naval Intelligence recovered debris
- Briefed by former CIA deputy director, told of 1933 Magenta crash and other recoveries
- Off-camera, claimed to have seen footage of Roswell survivor
