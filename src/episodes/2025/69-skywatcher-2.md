UAP whistleblower Jake Barber’s group, Skywatcher, has had a busy few weeks. They announced they intend to prove mechanical and psionic UAP summoning by the end of the year. To support that goal, they released a scientific discovery framework, a structured way to handle UAP research, with six levels that each require more scrutiny before eventually graduating to public acceptance. Plus, they dropped the second episode of their documentary series, which discussed the mechanical “dog whistle” they’ve developed, with a 100% success rate summoning UFOs, and included a classification guide to make sense of the different types of UAP they’ve seen in their experiments.

## Leading with Science

- James Fowler, partner at Skywatcher, runs the technology team: “So we stumbled into this, pretty much face planted right on this topic. We didn't want this topic to come into our lives. I'm not a ufologist. I don't believe. I'm not Fox Moulder. I have no faith in UFO/UAP stuff. I have no belief in off-planet. Frankly, we follow the data, and the data we have indicates that there's probably three buckets. There's probably a blue bucket, American made. There's probably a red bucket, made in China. And there's probably another bucket, which I don't know where that bucket comes from. This isn't a spiritual activity for us. This isn't emotional. This is strictly facts and data driven, and we've tried very hard to keep it that way.”
- Dr Garry Nolan, partner at Skywatcher: “So the usual question I get is, where's the evidence, where's the data? In science, just having data doesn't mean anything. So the reason there is a scientific process, is because it works, and it's replicable, and it's a standard upon which all science is accomplished. So… we're going to be able to collect the data and get it peer-reviewed. Not because the peer review tells you that the conclusion is right, but because that allows others to look at what it is that you did and determine whether or not you did it right.”

## Discovery Framework

- Chris Sharp, editor of Liberation Times: “ The Skywatcher Discovery Framework consists of six sequential levels, each requiring higher quality evidence and scrutiny before moving to the next… The Framework, led by lead author and strategic advisor Matthew Pines, emphasizes the importance of scientific rigour in investigating the phenomenon: ‘Our near-term goal is to establish a repeatable, falsifiable process that can be tested independently,’”
  - “Level 1: Preliminary Observation. Collect initial reports of sightings and filter out those with obvious explanations (aircraft, planets).”
  - “Level 2: Structured Data Collection. Gather data with instruments (cameras, radar, etc.) under standardized procedures, yielding tangible evidence for analysis​.”
  - “Level 3: Analysis & Hypothesis Testing. Analyze the high-quality data and test hypotheses to see if conventional explanations hold. Only if anomalies persist after rigorous analysis does a case move forward​.”
  - “Level 4: Independent Verification & Peer Review. Invite independent experts to re-examine the data and attempt to reproduce findings. Peer review and outside analysis at this stage ensure the anomaly is real and not an error​.”
  - “Level 5: Public Disclosure & Review. Release the vetted findings openly for broad scrutiny. Engage the public and scientific community to review, replicate, or challenge the results​.”
  - “Level 6: Full Discovery & Integration. If evidence is conclusive, the phenomenon is accepted as part of official knowledge. At this final stage, UAP findings (whether exotic or mundane) are integrated into science and policy with full transparency​.”
- Skywatcher: “In practice, a case begins with a sighting (Level 1), progresses through structured evidence collection (Level 2), and undergoes rigorous analysis (Level 3). If unexplained, it is verified independently (Level 4), disclosed publicly (Level 5), and, if conclusive, integrated into accepted knowledge (Level 6). For example, a recurring fast-moving object captured on video might escalate from a field report to recovery of physical material, potentially revealing new physics or technology.”
- Skywatcher: “The Framework isn't just an academic exercise, but something that citizen scientists, enthusiasts, or any interested person can understand. A clear Framework means the public can also gauge where a certain claim stands. For instance, if next month some group claims “we have unambiguous sensor data of UAP demonstrating beyond state-of-the-art capabilities” or even "we have retrieved exotic UAP craft", one can ask: “Have they provided Level 2 & 3 analysis? Was there peer review (Level 4)?” If not, skepticism is warranted. In contrast, if a claim has progressed methodically through these stages, one might give it more credence. Thus, the Framework also serves as a communication tool between investigators and the public.”

## “An Ambitious but Achievable Goal”

- Skywatcher: “[Our] team is prepared to set an ambitious but achievable goal: to scientifically resolve whether Electromechanical Signaling or Neuromeditative Interaction are credible and repeatable processes for attracting UAP by the end of 2025.”
- Sharp: “Neuromeditative Interaction is currently assessed at Level 2 of the framework – meaning the team has collected some structured observations but has not begun formal hypothesis testing. The next steps focus on tightening controls and ruling out normal explanations… Additionally, Skywatcher intends to monitor the physiological signals of the participants – such as brainwave activity (EEGs) and heart rate variability – to find any measurable changes that coincide with UAP sightings.”
- Sharp: “The document explains how five years have been spent refining a set of electronic ‘triggers’ – dubbed the ‘dog whistle’ – intended to prompt a UAP to show up. According to Skywatcher, preliminary results have been repeatable, with their signal configurations reliably drawing UAP to appear or fly directly overhead during field tests​.”
- Sharp: “Skywatcher is treating Electromechanical Signaling as a hypothesis in Level 3 – the analysis and testing phase – rather than a proven phenomenon​. To advance confidence, the next step is moving to Level 4: independent verification.”

## The Dog Whistle

- Fowler: “I started… running different projects for the government as a subcontractor. And through those activities we started noting anomalies, and one thing led to another. Now we have what we believe is compelling data on UAPs… We've been collecting UAP data for more than 5 years with electromechanical signaling, which we call our dog whistle… After we turn on the dog whistle, UAPs literally come to us, day after day.”
- Barber: “100% of the time when we run our operation with the dog whistle we get results in broad daylight that is visible from multiple observation posts.”
- Fowler: “We started a systematic cause and effect experimentation… Every time we turn on this equipment and do the things we need to do, for the right amount of time, we get a response. Every time. We've also experimented with _not_ using the equipment, and seeing if we see things, and we have not, which is interesting.”
- Matthew Pines, Skywatcher advisor: “To get confidence, you need to have a control, right? So the dog whistle is a certain very characteristic type of signal that you put out there, and then you wait to see if you’re going to see a characteristic set of observed UAP phenomenon appear or not, and then you do everything else ideally as constant as possible, you do a sort of random noise signal, nothing that you know is associated with attracting UAP, and you see, right, with every other condition the same, do UAP appear or not… When you flip the dog whistle on, the UAP appear, if you just flip on a noise control signal, they do not.”
- Fowler: “We've had over 300 sorties now of UAP incursions into our airspace where we're working. I call a sortie when we have an observation of a class of UAP moving through airspace. That class might be a flock. We've seen flocks of up to 20 plus. And we also have singletons that move through… So we've seen hundreds of UAPs. Perhaps we're running an event, and we have 200 sorties in a day. We don't know if that's one aircraft seeing 199 times more, or if that's 200 separate airframes, or aircraft, or UAPs, or whatever they are, moving through our airspace separately. So we just call it a sortie and accept what we don't know, and accept that as an observation from a technology and science perspective, this is one set of data.”

## UAP Classification Guide

- Fowler: “To make sense of our data, we had to define a lexicon, and we based it on flight characteristics. We've broken the UAPs down into nine classes or types. Some of these classes may be the same UAP under different flight configurations… Each UAP class has different characteristics. Some shimmer, some tumble, some spin. Some look like they're alive and they just fly like a living object in the sky… At this point, given their behavior, we're confident they don't align with conventional or terrestrial explanations.”
- Class 1: Tetra. Tetrahedron shaped UAP which tumbles on multiple axes while on a stable flight path. Often appears in groups of 3-20+.
  - Fowler: “The Class 1 often spins, tumbles through the sky. Craft looks like a black body. It appears to flash, pulse multiple times per second. There appears to be some kind of cloud or vapor around it. We've seen class ones in formations up to 20-23, flying in different flight formations.”
- Class 2: Tic Tac. Cylindrical UAP that hovers. Elongates during stable flight and has an area effect on electronics and aircraft. Seen in groups of 1 to 3. Observed with the Manta Ray in proximity.
  - Fowler: “We've seen it in groups of 2-3, often flying very erratically… We see them come straight down as if from space, tumbling and spinning at Mach 2 plus.”
  - Barber: “It showed up for several days in broad daylight, dropping from above 80,000 feet.”
- Class 3: Blob. Orb-shaped UAP that exhibits pulsing internal light, horizontal oscillation, and erratic point-to-point movement. Capable of extreme speed and rapid flare-driven expansion. Observed exclusively as singletons.
  - Fowler: “A pulsing vibrating cloud. There's something, maybe perhaps a cylinder kind of in the middle that has a different light like a flame, and then it vibrates and pulses as it moves through space.”
  - Fowler: “It looks like a pepto-bismol blob in the sky. I don’t even know how else to say it. It pulses and vibrates, and I don’t know what that means. I don’t know why we’re seeing that, but it’s definitely in the sky.”
- Class 4: Beam. IR-only orb-shaped UAP that vibrates while in a stable flight path. Hovers in place for hours at a time. Seen in pairs.
  - Fowler: “The Class 4 is your orb. We've only seen it in infrared. The class 4 seems to only come during certain activities, in conjunction with perhaps the class 1. We don't have enough data yet to confirm.”
- Class 5: Manta Ray. Manta-ray shaped UAP that tumbles on multiple axes. Rarely seen; observed in proximity to Tic Tacs.
  - Fowler: “It seems to tumble and rotate as it moves through the sky… It has round everywhere, I don't think there's anything straight or nearly straight.”
- Class 6: Bright Star. Reflective, tetrahedron-shaped UAP that oscillates horizontally, flashing light. Team has experienced sensor disruption apparently caused by directed energy.
  - Fowler: “That one vibrates very very fast. It literally looks like a crystal in the sky.”
- Class 7: Jellyfish. Jellyfish-shaped UAP with "seeking" head motion and trailing tentacles. Exhibits a localized area effect on electronics, independent of specific targeting or interaction with sensors.
  - Fowler: “We think the head of the jellyfish is about 2 meters in size. We think the tentacles hanging down are about 3 to 5 meters in size… The nodules on the tentacles light up… It appears to go from head to tail and pulse and light up the nodules as it goes…”
  - Fowler: “It seems to undulate as it moves… swimming in the sky… We have seen these take direct flight paths. We had two in formation… We chased down one of those two, and it deviated its flight path as we approximated, and then it elevated directly straight up, as in directly vertical.”
- Class 8: Hornet. Dual-body UAP with hanging tendrils and asynchronous rotation.
  - Fowler: “It looks very similar to the class 7, the jellyfish, except for it's bigger and it's almost like a jellyfish carrying something.”
- Class 9: Egg. Off-white, egg-shaped UAP. Provisional class designation; no corroborated motion, structure, or spectral data.
  - Fowler: “The class 9 isn't something we have a lot of data on. It's very limited. We had it at Skywatcher during our California event. It's an emerging class. We have strong evidence that it probably exists, but we don't have data to concisely describe it.”
- Barber: “We don’t have enough data yet on several types that some of us have only seen with the naked eye or captured on low resolution cell phone videos. We need supporting data in order to create a class. Specifically, this includes large black triangles, disks, and the 8-gon.”

## Footage Quality

- Fowler: “All of our data has been daytime. We have no data from night. None of our data are lights in the sky that you have to squint your eyes and put your finger on your nose and hope you see what you want to see. Our data is broad daylight, well lit, that’s very viewable.”
- Fowler: “[That said,] The system operator is having a very hard time keeping in frame because it's… so fast… Our servos don't move that fast. Our equipment can't handle that zoom factor with the speed.”
- Fowler: “UAPs are extremely hard to image. What is seen with a naked eye is generally not what is seen under camera.”
- Barber: “Vintage Camera Experts: We appreciate all the camera operator experts and enthusiasts that have been reaching out. Ideally, we would love a robust army of imagers helping us gather as much imagery as possible - from different angles, distances, and altitudes with a variety of equipment. Two of the primary challenges for our camera operators right now are digital interference and the extreme speed and movement of the objects… There seems to be something about the phenomenon that interferes with digital camera technology. Because of this we are looking to also add a vintage camera suite. There’s lots of evidence that suggests analog imagery of the phenomenon produces better results in some circumstances.”

## Interference

- Klokus: “We and the rest of our team are doing our very best to collect a robust set of data to share with all of you, but I hope you can understand that it's not as easy as it sounds. We're talking about objects that seemingly are able to appear and disappear in real time. We're talking about objects that seem to evade our sensors. They seem to actually turn our sensors off at times.”
- Klokus: “We sent the helicopter out to intercept the tic tac, but the first attempt failed because our radar was being jammed.”
- Barber: “Our helicopter launched and about a half mile out, the helicopter stopped moving. Engines running, blades turning, but it would not go forward, It would not go up, It would not go left or right, It was stuck there.”
- Gary Shipman, pilot: “We were called out to intercept an object that was found on radar. We went to the location it was supposed to be at, we circled a couple times and were requested to climb another thousand feet. The instrumentation started to bounce, and the collective basically was frozen. I've never experienced anything like it before. I’ve got over 4,000 hours of flight time and this has never happened before.”

## What’s Next?

- Fowler: “We are actively working with and seeking more third-party, non-UFOlogists, physicists, scientists, academia. We want them to come and analyze our data and produce third-party independent analysis… They would get full access to our data.”
- Klokus: “Part three of Skyatcher is going to be about psionics. It's going to be about the team that we've assembled. You're going to hear from some of them directly. You'll hear about their experience, their background, and how they found themselves here alongside us today. And if we can validate the existence of these abilities completely and scientifically, then that information necessitates an entirely new concept of reality and our place in it as human beings.”
