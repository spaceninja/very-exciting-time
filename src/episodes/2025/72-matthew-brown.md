Matthew Brown has gone public as the whistleblower who wrote the Immaculate Constellation report. Join us as we review his three-hour interview with Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp, covering how he discovered the program on the Pentagon’s secret internet, his attempts to report it to his chain of command, and how he came to write a report for Congress and become a public whistleblower. Plus, his startling theories about who is behind all the secrecy and what it means for the human race.

## Who is Matthew Brown?

Matthew Brown is a former US national security official who worked inside the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security, and the State Department. He held TS/SCI clearances, and handled with intelligence on weapons of mass destruction. He recently became a whistleblower, writing the Immaculate Constellation report that Journalist Michael Shellenberger shared with the world last year. That report has since been entered into the Congressional record, and alleges that the executive branch has illegally concealed a secret UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program from Congressional oversight.

## 2018 Schreiver Wargames Document

- Brown: “[I came across this] 100% accidentally…”
- Corbell: “How do you just come across UFO videos in the Pentagon? What does that mean?”
- Brown: “So, you have a clearance, and there’s a secret internet, and on that secret internet, there’s just generic access… It’s all very secret sensitive stuff, but more or less everyone can look at what’s on there. Then you have on this secret internet, some compartmentation… and then there’s entirely different systems for truly sensitive stuff, but the point is that there's essentially a shared community of knowledge, and just like our internet it goes back over decades.”
- Brown: ”The first exposure to Immaculate Constellation happened on a server that was shared by all the offices in OSD. What I was doing at the time was opening files that were clearly misfiled and either sorting them to our office’s part of that server or putting them in their own box to be sorted by other responsibilities.”
- Brown: “The file was labeled 2018 Schriever Wargames. [It’s a 12-15 page document]. There’s nothing about it that screams… interesting. A lot of wargame briefs are pretty boring. There's just a generic title slide. There's a banner without classification markings that just says Immaculate Constellation. And it has a placeholder slide that shows the Schriever Air Base logo and some logos of the units involved.”
- Brown: “So the next slide is where it gets interesting, because the face of Lue Elizondo is on that next slide. And that was not who I was expecting to see.”
- Brown: “It was accompanied by some text to summarize: Immaculate Constellation is an Unacknowledged Special Access Program established after the exposure of AATIP in 2017 by former USDI [Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence] officer Lue Elizondo.”
- Brown: “The third slide jumps straight into the mission of this SAP and showing what apparently the results of that mission are. And it’s a collection incident in the Pacific Ocean. The subject of collection is several Russian naval intelligence vessels in the middle of the ocean at night. And above those vessels is a large black triangle floating in the air.”
- Brown: “Our collection assets were there monitoring Russian naval vessels… A large black triangle materializes or decloaks or something. The point is, it did not move. It appeared directly above these ships, probably no more than 200 meters, pretty close. And interestingly, as noted in the report itself, there was no visible reaction from these vessels, from what would almost certainly be considered a hostile approach.”
- Brown “The analysis in the text was that the Russian Navy had foreknowledge that this vehicle would appear in this area of the ocean and they were there specifically to either collect on it themselves or to interact with it in some way.”
- Brown: “[After that] it was disappointing because we get into a couple slides of orbs and I had already seen orbs at this point in official setting.”
- Brown: “Based on the information included… the mission becomes apparent… It’s the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance mission of global nature for UAPs and ARVs”
- Brown: “We are collecting these incidents around the world. We are focused on the UAP/RV collection incidents by tasked and untasked assets, and the collection and analysis of those.”

## Was This Just a Fictional Wargame?

- Brown: “The first time I read that, I don’t know what I just read and if it’s even real. Maybe somebody just made this thing… or they put it together literally for a war game. Or they had maybe created an imaginary program that maybe they wanted to have. Or a desired capability or something that was representative of the true thing to be used…. It’s a weird thought, but this is what’s going through my head because it’s so bizarre… I’m going through all the options why it’s not what it is.”
- GPS World: “The Schriever Wargame 2018 scenario, set in the year 2028, will explore critical space issues and investigate the integration activities of multiple agencies associated with space systems and services… The SW 18 scenario depicts a notional peer space and cyberspace competitor seeking to achieve strategic goals by exploiting those domains… The scenario will also include a full spectrum of threats across diverse operating environments to challenge civilian and military leaders, planners and space system operators, as well as the capabilities they employ.”
- Reddit ChemicalPlant6487: “This is pure speculation, but if I were to ‘wargame’ the wargame theory, I could see something along the lines of the following being reality: In 2017, Luis Elizondo comes out with his breaking UAP story with the NY Times. The story is popular within the military/intelligence communities and the team developing the scenario for the 2018 Schriever Wargame decides to run with it. The team creates a backstory based on common UFO lore and photoshops some images of the Russian Navy working with a Black Triangle UAP as part of the conflict in the scenario. They create a SAP called Immaculate Constellation as part of this scenario. The scenario is one of several that the team develops, and it is not chosen as the official 2018 Schriever Wargame. The UAP scenario file is discarded and Matthew Brown eventually discovers it…”
- Reddit: “If that sounds ridiculous, another user pointed out that the US Department of Defense Strategic Command has run wargames on [zombie-apocalypse scenarios](https://www.cnn.com/2014/05/16/politics/pentagon-zombie-apocalypse/). These briefings were also classified at one point.”
- Wikipedia: “United States Strategic Command instructors found that a ‘zombie survival plan’ made for ‘a very useful and effective training tool’, while avoiding the political risks of using a real country in training scenarios.”

## Supporting Evidence

- Brown: “This document is the result of a multi-year, internal investigation into the subjects of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), Technologies of Unknown Origin (TUO), and Non- Human Intelligence (NHI). This investigation was undertaken in response to urgent and credible threats to the public good and safety of the United States of America… The data consulted during this investigation… originate from non-public data held within the Executive Branch of the United States Government (USG). The author obtained access to this information while pursuing their lawful duties as an employee of the Department of Defense.”
- When Michael Shellenberger reported on Immaculate Constellation, he found a second source, a former US intelligence community official, who confirmed the authenticity and existence of Immaculate Constellation, stating: 'That program is run out of [the Office of the Secretary of Defense].'
- Knapp: “You read one document that said Immaculate Constellation and has some images with it. What additional information did you come across that reinforced your belief that there is a big surveillance program collecting this stuff?”
- Brown: “There’s programs that have since become public. The most relevant one in this case is the NRO Sentient program.”
- Brown: “[Sanitizing intelligence is] a long standing practice, especially for imagery intelligence, nothing specific to UFOs. Back in the cold war days, if a facility or aerospace platform was collected, there would be a full version, for those who needed it. But if you just needed to see the facility, but maybe not the plane, those would be manually excised. Now we have tools to do that for us… [Sentient] demonstrates how you don’t need a massive workforce to do this anymore. You don’t need buildings without windows for acres with people taking this information and sanitizing it, making sure it gets to the right people without the wrong things in it.”
- Knapp: “These images that would pop up here and there on some platform, this AI program… Immaculate Constellation, it would grab them, take them away and then they're gone from those platforms? So, like the CIA?”
- Brown: “The data was ingested essentially in a stove pipe, right? It's locked off, it goes into the black box and then a product comes out for what you're cleared to see and what you have a need to know to see.”
- Knapp: “Wouldn't somebody say, hey, where's my image that I recorded and then? Where'd it go?”
- Brown: “There's a lot of people who have had incidents like that there.”

## Sentient AI

- Knapp: “Did we have an AI system in 2018 that could do what we're describing?”
- Brown: “Well, we know we did.Those documents have since become public, Sentient, and the fact that Sentient was operational at those dates of the documents mean it was operational for years before then, years before 2018.”
- Wikipedia: “Sentient is an artificial intelligence space-based satellite data analysis system… It is described as a heavily classified ‘artificial brain’ and automated system that allows intelligence agencies and armed forces to use satellite imagery and other data to autonomously find and track in real time targets on or above the Earth from outer space.”
- Verge: “All the images from the NRO, the military, and these commercial satellite firms, combined with other geospatial intelligence — anything that has a time tag and a location tag — create a vast amount of information that’s far more than a literal army of people could comb through. To keep up with the fire hose of information, the NRO turns in part to AI… Sentient is (or at least aims to be) an omnivorous analysis tool, capable of devouring data of all sorts, making sense of the past and present, anticipating the future, and pointing satellites toward what it determines will be the most _interesting_ parts of that future. That, ideally, makes things simpler downstream for human analysts.”
- The Black Vault received FOIA documents showing that Sentient detected a tic-tac in 2021, which it reported to the UAPTF. He also discovered it may have a model built specifically for detecting UAP: “NRO’s Sentient R&D as a UAP model to look for UAP [redacted] in imagery, but we need an external customer to ask for it to be turned on.”

## Reporting Slippage

- Brown: “So I do nothing for some time. Then our office gets training on what to do in cases of spillage for SAP material. I realized, well, no matter how weird this is, this has all the hallmarks of what you guys said is a big fucking deal. So I can either pretend like I didn’t open and read this thing 80 times, and hope it doesn’t notice that, or I can report it myself. So I did that, or I tried to do that.”
- Brown: “So the first time, I went to my immediate supervisor… I say I think we have a spillage thing… And he’s like, ‘Show me what you found’… The first slide, just because it’s so generic, gets no reaction. But then going to the second slide… he’s like ‘Stop. Did you read this?’ And I don’t answer, but I just look him in the eye… The conversation ended with him saying ‘Delete it’ and he left the room and we never spoke of it again.”
- Brown: “That didn’t sit right with me… That’s not what we’re supposed to do… Everything we do on those systems, every click, every keystroke is monitored. So [out of] self-preservation, I need to keep doing the right thing here. So I go to his boss’s boss.”
- Brown: “And this person says ‘okay, show me the material’… He scrolls through it. No reaction on his face. I’m watching him very closely at this point because I’m exceptionally curious about all this. No reaction. Then he… makes a very deliberate scene where he pauses on Lue Elizondo’s slide and starts guffawing in a very non-believable way and saying ‘Somebody’s having a joke. You don’t need to worry about this. You can go.’”
- Brown: “And that’s not the reaction I was expecting… I tried to ask him like, ‘Are you sure? Do I need to sign anything?’ and he’s like ‘Nope, you can go.’ So I left that room… and went upstairs to see what had happened to the file and it was gone.

## Disc in the Clouds

- Brown: “[The disc in the clouds video is] pretty striking, because you're watching it from space. It's always cool to watch satellite feeds, and that's just something the general public doesn't get to see. And then, just the size of it - it was immediately like, ‘Woah... what the hell is that?’ It’s almost playful in its activities - or like it was startled.”
- Brown: “It's just looking at an area over the ocean…..and this thing just comes trundling along, underneath the cloud cover, [it] comes up, and then right when it's almost center frame, it scoots off to the side and tries to get out.”
- Brown: “Nothing in those videos necessarily proves it's extraterrestrial or non-human… It certainly is anomalous, exotic and unexplainable… Some of it might have been within our capabilities to replicate, even in an inferior manner. But, quite a lot of it...it's either something else, or we live in a world where we have been left behind.”
- Corbell: “I can tell you that with my investigations with George Knapp over the last decade, we’ve been exposed to a lot of military film footage, where we have seen some of the footage that Matthew describes. That wasn’t in the Immaculate Constellation report. This is footage that can be seen on some of the classified servers by anyone who has that access. Now, separate from that, people have leaked footage to me and George Knapp. That is not the case with Matthew Brown, but we were able to hear what he said and know that some of that footage does exist, because I and George Knapp have both been exposed to some of it… [The footage he described showing a disc that appeared startled in the clouds], I’ve seen a long time ago, way before I ever met Matthew, and that is a piece of footage that within the intelligence community, if they have access to the servers, is kind of famous at this point.”

## Congressional Coverup

- Brown: “When I was in USDI, I read the transcripts of Sean Kirkpatrick briefing Senator Rubio, Senator Warren, and Senator Gillibrand on the results of his investigation in his congressionally tasked AARO report.”
- Brown: “Kirkpatrick absolutely distorted, downplayed, and… outright lied to the people who have direct responsibility for him… ‘We just don’t have enough data to really know what this is. We don’t have any way of really figuring out what’s going on. It could just be an anomaly.’ So, starting with an acknowledgement that you have some data, but we have the insight and the scientific expertise to make you feel at ease… I immediately knew that I had inside knowledge into the deception of our government by elements of our intelligence community.”
- Brown: “My blood ran cold at a specific point… where Mr Rubio is discussing the legacy program. This was a subject of direct discussion with Sean Kirkpatrick at these meetings. And based on Mr Kirkpatrick’s replies, vague as they were, but unable to escape the truth of the legacy program, Mr Rubio’s response was ‘Well, what the hell is the executive branch doing? Have they been running this for 60 years without congressional oversight?’”
- Rubio, June 2023: “It’s very problematic if it’s accurate, because if that is accurate — and again, I’m not in a position yet to make that judgment — but if that is accurate, what you’re basically saying is that within the government of the United States, there’s a group of people who believe that they possess something that they don’t need to share with anybody, including elected officials who they view as temporary employees of the government. And, you know, in essence, some sort of an internal military complex that’s their own government and is accountable to no one. So it would be a huge problem if it’s even partially true.”

## Decision to Whistleblow

- Liberation Times: “Aware that his superiors were not being truthful about what they knew, Brown decided to act. He brought his concerns to both the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committees, [seeking whistleblower protection], knowing that Committee members were urging whistleblowers to come forward. Brown described an initial meeting in which a staffer from the Intelligence Committee took his allegations and safety concerns seriously. He was then told to expect a meeting with a staffer from the Armed Services Committee, followed by a joint meeting with members from both committees.”
- Liberation Times: “But according to Brown, follow-up meetings never materialised. Wanting to provide additional information, he reached out again. However, he describes being given ‘the runaround’. A staffer then sent a blunt response, which Brown characterised as ‘you either send me what you have in writing here on this non-official channel, or you don't.’ Brown sent the information, but was disillusioned by Congress’ inaction to properly respond and protect whistleblowers.”
- Liberation Times: “In the winter of 2023–2024, Brown reconnected with the Senate Intelligence Committee - this time through a new staffer who had replaced the staffer he originally spoke to. Upon learning that no notes had been taken during his previous testimony, Brown decided to write his own report to send to Congress. After submitting his report, Brown then met with permanent staff members from the Senate’s Intelligence and Armed Services Committees.”
- Liberation Times: “But still fearing for his safety, Brown decided to reach out to select journalists. That’s when he connected with journalism team Corbell and Knapp, as well as Michael Shellenberger. He sought permission to publish his report on IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION through the State Department’s Bureau of Global Public Affairs, submitting it for Pre-Publication Review. Once his report was approved for publication, Brown permitted Michael Shellenberger to publish some of its details.”
- Liberation Times: “The official, authorised and full report was then delivered to Congress via Corbell - who also facilitated a series of in-person meetings for Brown with select Members of Congress.”

## Lack of Whistleblower Protections

- Knapp: “[There are other whistleblowers who] worked in classified programs their whole life, that’s what they do, how they pay their bills, and they’re being held in limbo. That’s held over their heads so they don’t come forward… We’ve heard promises ‘We’ll help whistleblowers come forward, we’ll give them support.’ There are private equity funds and organizations that say they’re gonna help, but we haven’t seen shit so far, have we?”
- Brown: “I’ve reached out directly to institutions that claim that they are here to help UAP whistleblowers specifically, both in the process of coming forward and any sort of stability afterwards. It’s been radio silence at best. At worst, one of those institutions has stolen my information. There is no organized help for whistleblowers. It is all controlled. It is all either the special interest of industry that wants to get in on this, or by the existing powers that be.”
- Knapp: “Intelligence agencies who have infiltrated or created these things.”
- Brown: “Correct.”
- Brown: “I am, on a personal level, giving up the future that I made for myself and was going to try to make for a family… My hope is that the stakes are not paid out, but they are life imprisonment and the possibility of execution.”
- Knapp: “You’ve gotten to know some of these other whistleblowers who are still not public yet… but are at least close to coming forward. Is there strength in numbers?”
- Brown: “Yes. And if all of us die or are imprisoned, the seeds have been planted. More will come.”
- Knapp: “Do you think anyone has been killed because they knew too much on this topic?”
- Brown: “Yes, I believe, and I think, and I could probably help someone else prove it. But lethal action has been taken against people that tried to get the truth out.”
- Corbell: “We have had very disturbing personal threats that we take extremely seriously. Not just with Matt, but with some of the other whistleblowers who have already recorded with us… This is serious. It's happening… There's a small army of whistleblowers ready to come forward, we have already recorded with them. The levee is breaking. The American public has not just a right, but a need to know.”

## Nov 2024 UAP Hearing

- Corbell: “Getting something on Congressional record is a little bit more tricky than people think. They have to have time with it. So I very slowly, with your authorization, over those months, had in-person meetings, not just you being there, but then working with them, showing them the information, so they had time to vet it… It was a process… There were a lot of phone conversations that we sat in on with the house staff, and they got curiouser and curiouser the people who were in on these conversation with us… National security folks just popping in on a meeting that I’m supposed to be having with them, you know, they wanted to know what assets George and I have… They were saying at one point that we were going to testify… in a SCIF. And our federal lawyer said, do not go in there because they will immediately classify all that information… and then you’re never reporting on it.”
- Mace, in her opening statement: “I’m not going to name names, but there are certain individuals who did not want this hearing to happen - they feared what might be disclosed. But we stood firm. No amount of outside pressure would ever keep me from pursuing a subject to ground - come hell or high water.”
- Brown: “I think it will take quite a change in our present circumstances for anybody to ever testify under oath on this subject again, in a way that would make a difference. I think they know the power of, in an open hearing, putting your hand on the Bible and swearing that you're gonna speak nothing but the truth and doing so. It's symbolic, and it's very valuable, and that is why I believe that they are desperately attempting to deny and control it.”
- Corbell: “That’s what we saw at the second hearing. Absolutely controlled. Rep Burchett testified to it by saying it publicly that the executive branch did limit what could be said and by who.”
- Brown: “The executive branch in the halls of Congress determining what the business of Congress is. And not even through the courtesy of a phone call to the Vice President or the President, but through minions and stooges, unelected, probably CIA.”
- Brown: “[After all that, getting my testimony on the congressional record was a big win.] There was a bit of personal pleasure too. I got to see someone else be scared for once. Not the bosses of the people who interfered in Congress, but the minions themselves, because their bosses didn't tell them what was going to happen. By all appearances, both behind the scenes and in front of them, the submission of this report onto the Congressional Record, and its announcement, caught people by surprise. Its distribution was allegedly very tight, and these unelected members on these congressional staffs that get to set the agenda for our elected leaders had to scramble and adjust in real time. They panicked.”

## Secrecy

- Brown: “[After the NYT article, there was a clampdown on UFO discussion.] The screws were tightened and in certain agencies, you're not allowed to mention certain whistleblowers' names, or you'll be fired immediately… [Dave Grusch’s] name was absolutely, from first-hand experience, sort of radioactive in the chat rooms. All of a sudden, these people that never participate are there, really slamming him and slamming the people talking about him.”
- Brown: “If it was just technology that we were worried about protecting and maintaining military advantage, there's strong arguments to be made… that the… American people… be left in the dark about where science, technology, and their military are taking them. This isn't just technology. This isn't something somebody came up with in a lab, and it's sensitive because once the cat's out of the bag, anybody can do it. Fundamentally, this comes from… the biggest question, which is, ‘Is humanity alone?’ The answer is no, and the secrecy that has been defended is at the cost of, in my mind, human dignity, freedom, and progress. It is no longer permissible or acceptable, in my mind, to continue this course - to deprive another generation, not just of Americans but of humanity, of their birthright to know who they are, where they came from, and what's with us.”
- Brown: “It's a parallel reality. The secrecy apparatus is all-pervasive. It is not just in the intelligence community governing their world. It's not just the military protecting their operations… It has been allowed to corrupt and infest every aspect of our society to serve the interests and whims of a very elite select few.”

## Breakaway Civilization

- Brown: “I think our military has a long, historic involvement in this. So does our intelligence community and our scientific academic community. We have, as a country, allowed ourselves to be penetrated, co-opted, and corrupted by an internationalist force that serves their interests and views nations, peoples, as tools and means to an end.”
- Brown: “[UAP secrecy] doesn't ultimately reside in the government anymore. This is held in an illegal internationalist regime; some sort of international cabal of sorts, [a] mix of corporate, military, political, intelligence and criminal interests that have come together. And they have subverted us and have taken this and have made it the source of their wealth and power.”
- Intel Officer quoted by Bernard Haisch: “The elite involved in the black programs are among the smartest people on the planet, but even so remain deeply puzzled by much of what they’ve learned. They tend to regard the public with disdain, like undisciplined and unruly children incapable of handling information of extraordinary complexity. While officially supporting democracy, the black program elite in reality espouse a kind of benevolent dictatorship or enlightened oligarchy by those, such as themselves, who have earned the right to know and to make decisions in the best interest of civilization, to which the ordinary person, being lazy and easily distracted, is not motivated or qualified to contribute anyway.”

## Who Are They?

- Corbell: “Who are the others? Why are they here?”
- Brown: “I have been exposed to no direct information on the anatomy, biology, intentions, culture, or politics.”
- Brown: “I think they’re both just as powerful as we think but also less. And I think there is not a single ‘they’ here. Certainly multiple factions of the same species if not multiple species, and all the complexity that brings, which might be our best hope.”
- Brown: “I have a good degree of confidence that the reason they’re here is _us_. I think life, especially sentient life, it’s a precious thing, and I think to some it might be a resource. I think humanity to some level is a resource for them. Possibly a commodity, possibly a form of entertainment, possibly medical related… It appears they’ve been here for most of recorded history. I think some element of this has been here for most of human recorded history.”

## Matrix

- Brown: “What I have learned is that we live in a dream, a carefully constructed reality. We make use of a science that is tightly controlled and suppressed and distorted. I think we are left behind… The normal humans have been left behind.”
- Brown: “People need to understand that we might have freedom of speech but that has been subverted. We do not have freedom of inquiry. We are blocked from learning what we need to know just in the public world. We are blocked from advancing in science. We are taught false science intentionally to prevent us from learning more. We live in the matrix. It’s just much more boring than the movie.”
- Brown: “Ultimately, my biggest fear is what humanity will do to itself out of fear and greed. 'We have built a prison around ourselves. It's invisible, but it's not complete, and there is still time to maybe alter our trajectory.”
- Corbell: “If you were to die tomorrow because of whatever reason, what do you want people to know?”
- Brown: “You are not free. And this reality has far more to it than you have been allowed to believe. And God is real.”
