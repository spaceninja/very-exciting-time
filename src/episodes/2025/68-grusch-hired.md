Rep. Eric Burlison has hired UAP whistleblower David Grusch to his personal staff. This will allow Grusch to advise Burlison (who is on the House Oversight Committee and is investigating UFOs for the Federal Secrets Task Force) on the topic of UFOs, and enable Congress to restore his clearance, so he can step into a SCIF to brief the Task Force, along with Lue Elizondo and Christopher Mellon!

- 3/11: Rep Eric Burlison: “[We’re looking into bringing Grusch into a SCIF] and hiring him on staff. Either my personal staff [or the committee]. I already talked to [oversight committee chairman] Comer’s team about it. They’re researching it. I can [hire him from my personal office], but I think that it would be ideal if he were part of the [oversight] committee, because… he’s not just working for me, he’s working for the efforts of the team… I want to get him hired. I want to get him on board and then just move quickly, because we don’t have a lot of time.”
  - Rep Burlison: “It is, yeah… I’ve got my head down. I think [Luna] has, you know, given me a lot of latitude to do this research.”
- 3/25: Rep Burlison: “I think that it’s frustrating to me that we can’t continue to get any further. One of the things that was highlighted to me is that we don’t have someone who’s an expert in this field helping us navigate the intelligence community….the thing is you don’t know which questions to ask. So how do you determine where to go when you don’t have the first clue?”
  - NewsNation reporter Joe Khalil: “That is why somebody like David Grusch, with his experience and with the claims that he has now made under oath, is so valuable. He can help out Congressman Burlison when he is in committee, to ask the right questions, to follow the right lines of inquiry, pull the right threads. And you can just imagine how valuable having somebody like that is, not just as an outsider advisor but inside your office as a paid worker and staffer. It could be a game changer.”
  - Burlison: “Hiring Grusch gives us the precision to do a rifle shot at this topic and try to get the answers quick.”
- 3/19: Rep Anna Paulina Luna: “I spoke to Rep Burlison, and he has obtained permission to bring Grusch on as a staffer. We will be working directly with him in conducting investigations.”
- 3/21: NewsNation reporter Joe Khalil: “UAP whistleblower David Grusch has officially been approved for and accepted a position to work on Congressman Burlison’s personal office staff. Grusch’s title will be ‘Senior Advisor’ and will mostly advise on UAP/UFO related topics. His role will begin as a temporary 4-month post. Important note here: Grusch will NOT be working with the House Oversight Committee—the committee before which he once testified. He will only be working with/advising Rep Burlison, who serves on the Oversight Committee and the [Federal Secrets] Task Force.”
- 3/27: David Grusch: “I’m both immensely humbled and deeply honored to join Congressman Burlison… The public is rightfully demanding to know the truth… I will use all my expertise to support Rep. Burlison and help the US Congress restore full oversight… to investigate and hold those accountable who have broken the law and lied not only to our Congress, but also to the Executive Office of the President, Director of National Intelligence, and Department of Justice.” 
- 3/27: Rep Burlison: “He starts April 1. He’s filling out the paperwork… We’re working on [his clearance]. That was, in fact, one of my first actions. As soon as he signed and we agreed, I signed a document to request that his clearance be restored.”
- 3/27: Rep Luna: “We got that confirmed for some time in April, [getting Grusch in a SCIF with Lue Elizondo]… and Christopher Mellon!”
- 3/28: Lue Elizondo: “Chris Mellon, myself and our colleagues were in Washington D.C. this week and had the opportunity to meet with several Senators/Representatives and/or their staffs to discuss the current UAP and drone issues facing our nation. I am extremely encouraged and humbled to see the level of effort and investment by these officials. Please keep in mind that in our eagerness to obtain transparency we need to allow them the necessary time to work on these incredibly complex issues. This is a great step forward but we need to have patience as they begin to peel back the decades of denial and misinformation. I am very encouraged by the direction they are taking and so should you.”
