We’re kicking off the new year with two new interviews with UAP whistleblower David Grusch, who drops some juicy new details, including that he was partially read into government UFO programs, that there are multiple feuding programs with no central leadership, and that former DNI James Clapper managed the UFO crash retrieval program.

## Fox News Interview

- Fox News Host Bret Baier:  ”You believe that we have encountered alien beings, and that they've come to earth, and that we know about it as a US government.”
  - Grusch: “ That seems to be the case. I don't like to characterize necessarily where they came from. They're definitely some kind of non-human sentient, but it is true, believe it or not, we've recovered the vehicles, and we actually have physical proof. I was actually partially cleared into some of those activities. It was beyond oral testimony provided to me. I actually had partial access to the data and actually read the intelligence reports resulting from those programs.”
- Baier: “Were there pictures?”
  - Grusch: “Yes, there were.”
- Baier: “ When I said from another planet or from outer space, you said… we don't know where they're from. Is it interdimensional? What are we talking about?”
  - Grusch: “ I've talked to a lot of, I'll call gray beards on the program, that is a subject of hot debate on origin… As a guy trained in physics… I leave an open mind on what the origin is. Certainly, there is the extraterrestrial hypothesis, and they could be coming from elsewhere off earth, but I don't usually go there 'cause I did not see that data, and I'm not conversant in the high confidence theories that the US government had.”
- Baier: “ You say the US government knows, but there are many other governments around the world. Do they know?”
  - Grusch: “ They have their own programs. And like I said, two and a half years ago, we have been in an arms race with our peer competitors, namely Russia and China… I was actually able to view a body of intelligence that discussed adversarial programs, and I'll leave it at that.”
- Baier: “ We've recovered things you say… Bodies and physical remains. Was there a sense of the motive… how they got here, what they were doing, was it peaceful, not peaceful?”
  - Grusch: “ We've seen a mixed bag of activity. And motive and intent, why they're visiting, once again, that gets into our assessments. Not necessarily, we can't quite understand the intent of some of the sentients and why they're visiting. Could it be because we have interesting genetic material on earth? Or we're a Jurassic Park, tourist attraction for them?   Could be a myriad of reasons.”

## Megyn Kelly Interview

- Megyn Kelly: “ I've always been sort of open-minded to this issue, but more skeptical and… my skepticism is gone, having watched _The Age of Disclosure_.  It's incredibly well done, and they've got everybody, I mean, all of these  astrophysicists and extremely well educated and accomplished scientists who have been investigating this… on camera, on the record, saying as much as they can.”
  - Grusch: “ [I applaud] these individuals for… coming forward and speaking. And like you, I was a very skeptical person… I was interested in space and science… as a child. I ended up studying physics… I was in positions of high trust in the government at the most extreme levels,  having walked the halls of the West Wing, personally handled the Presidential Daily Intelligence brief and had some of the same broad accesses as the president and his cabinet… [I thought] I would know if this exists. Somebody would've slipped and said something to me. At the time, I was briefed to over 90% of all black programs in the Department of Defense and also the intelligence community. And I had an arrogant opinion of the topic. I was certainly open to the idea, but I figured I haven't seen any evidence and I would've been briefed into those kind of things, because I had a need to know at the time.  So I came into it very similar to you…  I was very skeptical.”
  - Grusch: “When I was eventually brought into this topic, working for the UAP task Force…  I was thinking, oh, I'll figure out what this is. This might be some kind of US program, some prosaic natural phenomenon, some kind of adversarial program, some strategic technical surprise.  But eventually, as I started pulsing my networks, digging into archives where, we'll just say certain programs forgot to fully clean out safe drawers.”
  - Grusch: “So, a combination of oral testimony, audio-visual evidence, and documentation… and then interviewing over 40 people all the way up to… the cabinet level over the course of four years… I became convinced, at a high confidence level, that the US has engaged in a crash retrieval, in reverse engineering operation of… non-human crafts and recovering the biologics as well.”
- Kelly: “ [The documentary is] saying they found some sort of alien beings bodies along with the crafts, that the government has had it for decades, and it's happened multiple times… The whole theory of the entire movie with all of these storied experts—and these are not crackpots. I mean, if they're crack pots, boy, they found dozens of them who have been at the highest levels of our government over generations—Who are all saying, yes, this has happened. And the reason that they keep it secret from everyone, including… our own presidents… is what?”
  - Grusch: “Well, it depends on the… administration.  Certainly there were former secretaries of defense and presidents that were briefed on this matter. It depended on the level of trust that the… lifers in the government had with those individuals. And unfortunately, this subject has been a victim of a lot of… domestic information operations. There’s certainly been this Game of Thrones activity with multiple factions… in a bipartisan manner… but it is true that a lot of people have been withheld.”
  - Grusch: “I was very disturbed to find how this was controlled… Unaccountable, everybody owns a piece. Nobody owns the outcome, and there’s not really a mob boss. The closest person we got that I was aware of was unfortunately now deceased, Vice President Dick Cheney, Darth Vader himself. Not shocking that he was involved in this, and essentially when he left in 2009, that was the last time that these activities really had central leadership.”
- Kelly: “ When it's super secret, they've been offloading the research to private contractors and that way they don't have to include any of these disclosures in response to FOIA requests made of the federal government because it's been given to a private entity.”
  - Grusch: “ That's totally true… Early in the global war on terror a lot of the money that was initially given to these companies was… reallocated for overseas contingency operations. And these contractors… started to do their own thing, if you will, something called IRAD (internal research and development), and privately they continued certain things that actually the government was trying to cancel as it relates to this subject. And they went off and retrieved and exploited things essentially on their own and only loosely accountable back to their government handlers.”
- Grusch: “ I did wanna point out General Clapper, the former Director of National Intelligence in the documentary. I certainly applaud him for at least speaking out in general. He goes on… where there was a program when he was the DNI where they were tracking these vehicles over Area 51… and I'm a little bit disappointed as a fellow Air Force officer… that’s all he said in the documentary, that was a program he was aware of.”
  - Grusch: “ In fact, without being inappropriate, I will say that General Clapper was well aware of the crash retrieval issue. Managed the crash retrieval issue and when he was the DNI USDI DIA director, he placed people in critical roles to manage this issue, both publicly and I'll just say non-publicly as well… So, General Clapper, Stephanie O’Sullivan, other folks in the IC that are well aware of this issue, that were in rooms discussing this issue, I ask you to be greater leaders on this. I should not be the only former military officer and intelligence official that is being completely candid with the information that they were exposed to.”
