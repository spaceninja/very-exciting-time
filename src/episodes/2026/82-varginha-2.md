Recently, James Fox released an updated version of the “Moment of Contact” documentary about the UFO crash and alien encounters in Varginha, Brazil in 1996. Among the new witnesses are the doctor who performed the autopsy on the military police officer who died after capturing an alien, and a doctor who met a living alien that received treatment in the hospital

## Obama says Aliens are Real

- Brian Tyler Cohen: “Are aliens real?”
- President Barack Obama: “They’re real, but I haven’t seen them, and they’re not being kept in… Area 51. There’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy, and they hid it from the president of the United States.”

## Varginha: New Revelations

- Leslie Kean & Ralph Blumenthal in the Debrief: “Over a large box of untouched donuts in Washington’s Longworth House Office Building, Congressional representatives sat rapt as a visiting Brazilian neurosurgeon described what it was like to stare back at the large lilac-colored eyes of a highly intelligent, nonhuman being. So, not your usual Capitol Hill meeting.”
- Debrief: “The closed-door session on Jan. 15 brought together three members of Congress seeking greater government transparency on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, long called UFOs, and a group of Brazilians who say they witnessed the crash of an otherworldly spacecraft and later encountered its nonhuman occupants.”
- Debrief: “The story is this: On January 13, 1996, in the countryside outside the municipality of Varginha, Brazil, the geography teacher—also an ultralight pilot—reported seeing a cylindrical craft trailing smoke and crashing to Earth. A week later, three girls walking home through a vacant lot reported encountering a cowering creature with reddish eyes and brown oily skin that reportedly communicated its suffering through its eyes. Before long, the streets of Varginha were filled with military trucks and emergency vehicles amid rumors of the capture of two nonhuman beings, one later hospitalized, and a clandestine American operation that spirited them out of Brazil.”
- Debrief: “There is no question that the Varginha case lacks hard data. No one has yet been able to come up with photographs or videos, physical evidence, official documentation, or medical records that could help verify the episode. Yet over two dozen witnesses to many aspects of the case have come forward independently, providing pieces of a puzzle that seem to fit together to tell a compelling story.”

## Carlos De Sousa

- Debrief: “Carlos de Sousa, a geography teacher and ultralight pilot, told the representatives that he saw a “cigar-shaped” craft that he first thought was a blimp with a lateral tear trailing white smoke and struggling to stay aloft before crashing near a highway.”
- De Sousa: “I witnessed the crash of a non-terrestrial craft on January 13, 1996. I was en route [to] an ultralight pilots' gathering. When I made a brief stop near Varginha, I looked skyward. I spotted a cigar-shaped object which seemed distressed. Initially, I assumed it was a blimp, common at the time over soccer fields for broadcasts.”
- De Sousa: “It released white smoke while losing altitude. It made a slight turn that revealed a lateral tear from the middle to the back. It was clearly having problems. I quickly realized that the occupants could be in deep trouble. I got in my car and followed its trajectory towards the crash site, hoping to be able to help. When I got there I smelled a foul odor - like ammonia with rotten eggs, burning my eyes. Half the craft remained intact by a tree, and the debris of the back part was scattered everywhere.”
- De Sousa: “Multiple army vehicles arrived promptly. At that point I was in the middle of the wreckage, and picked up a lightweight fragment resembling aluminium foil. I crumpled it in my hand, but when I let go, it instantly resumed its original shape. A soldier approached fast and hit me in chest with his rifle so I was forced to drop the metal. He shouted: ‘Leave now!’ I replied: ‘No, people in there need help!’ He aimed his gun at my head, and said: ‘I’m not requesting, it’s an order. Leave now, or I'll split your skull.’ I turned and departed immediately. I was very scared and confused.”
- De Sousa: “I left the area and stopped at the first gas station to compose myself. A few minutes later a very dark blue (near-black) vehicle pulled up. Two suited men got out and approached me. One called me by name, stating my address, and naming my wife and business. I asked, ‘Who are you?’ He threatened: ‘You saw nothing, you know nothing - or you will have problems for the rest of your life. Understood?’ They departed swiftly. I grabbed a napkin to write down the license plate - but there wasn't one.”

## Dr. Armando Fortunato

- Debrief: “Dr. Armando Fortunato, who has been a forensic pathologist and criminal medical examiner for the Civil Police for over three decades, told the representatives that he had performed an autopsy on a young military police officer, Marco Chereze, who had grabbed one of the beings during its capture and then died a few weeks later from a severe infection after it inadvertently scratched him.”
- Fortunato: “I was assigned to perform the autopsy on the body of the 23-year-old soldier, Marco Chereze, whose unexpected death led the Commander of the Military Police of the State of Minas Gerais to request an investigation on suspicion of professional error. It was considered unusual that a young, healthy soldier would die as a result of what appeared to be a simple abscess in the underarm area. A recent scar was observed in the left underarm region, as a result from the surgical drainage of an infectious lesion.”
- Fortunato: “The patient died a few days later, despite having been evaluated and treated by other physicians with high doses of anti-inflammatory medications and antibiotics. As the infection was caused by a highly virulent and multi drug-resistant bacterium, it progressed rapidly, spreading throughout the body and resulting in septic shock, eventually leading to the death of the young soldier. I sent organ fragments and blood samples to my colleague, the renowned pathologist Dr. João Batista Janini, for laboratory assessments and further clarification.”

## Dr. João Janini

- Debrief: “Dr. Armando handed the representatives a signed statement from Dr. João Janini, 89, a specialist in pathological anatomy whose biography states he has performed over 50,000 autopsies. Janini attested that he had found a rare form of a bacterium “of extremely high aggressiveness and lethality” in the tissue samples from Chereze.”
- Janini: “My name is Dr. João Janini. I am a professor and doctor, with specialization in Pathological Anatomy. I worked professionally for 60 years, during which I performed more than 50.000 autopsíes, conducted over one million microscopic analyses, and served as a preceptor to more than 200 postgraduate students.”
- Janini: “The access granted to me was limited exclusively to tissue fragments collected during the autopsy of the body of soldier Marco Chereze. Subsequently, I received circumstantial reports presented by gentlemen Ufologists, who requested a review of the previously mentioned material. Based on these reports, I prepared my conclusions focusing exclusively on the identification and analysis of the bacterium responsible for the infection that afÍected the soldier.”
- Janini: “This bacterium proved to be a microbial agent of extremely high aggressiveness and lethality. Given its characteristics, I understand that it goes beyond the limits of a conventional infection, possibly presenting itself as a highly specialized mechanism of aggression and defense, which raises the hypothesis of its alien origin.”
- Janini: “We are currently awaiting the necessary legal procedures for the exhumation of the body, with the expectation that advanced studies in Molecular Biology may provide new evidence regarding its mechanisms of aggressiveness, corroborating the hypothesis that it is an organism of extraterrestrial origin. lf confirmed, such a finding would represent unequivocal proof of the existence of extraterrestrial life, implying a profound global reformulation of our philosophical understanding of existence.”

## Dr. Italo Venturelli

- Debrief: “Dr. Italo Venturelli, who was on duty that day in Regional Hospital in Varginha, said the captured being was initially treated by his colleague, Dr. Neves, who sutured a wound on its cranium. Neves died in 2018, and no medical records were kept of this procedure, according to Dr. Italo.”
- Italo: “I held onto a very big secret for 29 years, sharing it only with a few medical colleagues, even though many others knew what I knew. In 2023, I revealed to James Fox and his team that I had seen a video of a non-human creature in the hospital on January 20, 1996. After suffering a near fatal heart attack in 2024, I felt compelled to share more details of my experience, despite previous concerns about the consequences for my career.”
- Italo: “That afternoon in 1996, I was working at Varginha Regional Hospital when my colleague and fellow neurosurgeon Marcos Vinício Neves urgently called me into an improvised intensive care room. He was carrying a large video camera. Upon entering, he showed me a black and white video on the camera screen, that appeared to be a child lying in bed with an extreme case of hydrocephalus. I asked, ‘What is this?’ He pointed past the makeshift partition, where a being was lying. I got closer. The moment I looked at the being, I immediately knew it was not human.”
- Italo: “I first examined it from a medical perspective: breathing well, no apparent pain, conscious, no bleeding. It seemed fine, with a calm and serene expression. It looked like a seven year old child with a sheet covering up to its waist. Its eyes were lilac and teardrop shaped, the cranium was also teardrop shaped. The skin was white, the arms very thin, and the hand had three fingers and an opposing thumb. It had no nipples, and a tiny mouth.”
- Italo: “It looked at me, then looked at the blue sky through the window as if longing to be there. It then looked back at me. After that, I sensed it was fully aware of what was happening around it and our intention to help. I felt it was grateful for the care and wanted to leave. Its serenity and powerful presence led me to believe it had a very high level of intelligence and perception, higher than human beings. It seemed like an angel, with understanding and compassion in its gaze, aware that – despite our limitations – we were doing the best we could for it.”
- Debrief: “During the private discussion in Burchett’s office, Dr. Italo said he had learned that the being he saw was taken to ESA military base, then to Campinas, and then to the States. ‘All the people we talked to said the exact same thing,’ Fox told the representatives.”
