Scott’s coming at you solo with the latest updates on UFO Whistleblower David Grusch’s story. This week we’re covering his video interview with Ross Coulthart, where among other revelations he shared that the Vatican helped the US recover a crashed UFO from Italy in 1945, and that the US government possibly has “agreements” with non-human intelligences. Not to mention running a decades-long coverup and disinformation operation against US citizens. We also cover the latest Congressional reactions to Grusch’s story, as well as Michael Shellenberger’s story with additional sources confirming Grusch’s claims.

## New Grusch Claims from Coulthart Video

- **Grusch has seen/verified the evidence** to back these claims. Has seen **”photos and documents”.** His job was essentially to research and corroborate witness testimony, which led him here.
- Grusch **investigated this topic for 4 years** before believing:
  - Says he investigated the topic for four years before believing it was credible enough to submit to the DOD IG: “I started out as a non-believer. I came to the problem as a hardcore physics guy … intel officer… So I have a high bullshit factor… I was very methodical… interviewing people who didn’t know each other and making sure this wasn’t some kind of cover-up of some other program… I thought it was totally nuts and I thought at first I was being deceived. People started to confide in me … approaching me. I had plenty of senior, former intelligence officers that came to me, many of which I knew almost my whole career, that confided in me that they were part of a program. They named the program… I’d never heard of it. They told me, based on their oral testimony, and they provided me documents and other proof, that there was in fact a program that the UAP Task Force was not read into.”
- He tried and failed to **gain access to the program**.
  - “They shut the door in my face. They denied me access to these programs.”
- Grusch mentioned **people working with these recovered UAPs have gotten sick**.
  - “A lot of them were injured looking at some of this stuff,” he said. “You can imagine the nuclear, radiological and biological risks to looking at an unknown. And a lot of them have literally suffered physically because of their service.”
- Grusch has talked to AARO head Kirkpatrick
  - “Well, I know Dr. Shawn Kirkpatrick, for about eight years. And I expressed some concerns to Dr. Kirkpatrick about a year ago and I told him what I was starting to uncover and he didn’t follow up with me. He has my phone number, he could have called me.”
- The Vatican helped the US recover a crashed UFO following the collapse of the fascist Italian regime
  - “1933 was the first recovery in Europe, in Magenta, Italy. They recovered a partially intact vehicle, and the Italian government moved it to a secure airbase in Italy until around 1944-1945. The Pope back-channeled that, and told the Americans what the Italians had and we ended up scooping it.”
- Multiple operational craft have been recovered.
  - “Quite a number” of crafts have been recovered by the US. **At least 12 according to Grusch**.
- NHI occupant **bodies have been recovered**.
  - “Well, naturally, when you recover something that’s either landed or crashed … sometimes you encounter dead pilots.”
- It’s implied that the US government may have an **existing formal relationship/agreement with some NHI factions**.
  - “Agreements that risk putting our future in jeopardy”.
- It’s implied the **US government have killed people** to keep this information suppressed.
- An **ongoing broad UFO disinformation campaign** is being perpetrated by the US government. As part of this campaign, Grusch claims **some “true” or factual intel has been presented or pushed, along with false claims** **or disinformation** in an effort to muddy the narrative.

## Growing Bipartisan Congressional Interest

- R Rep. Tim Burchett, asked if Grusch would testify at the hearing: “We would like to get him there. It’s premature to say who we will have there… We’re waiting on approval for several people, and then when we get that we’ll move ahead with firming up a date… We’ve got security concerns and we just want to make sure we have our ducks in a row.”
- D Rep. Jared Moskowitz: “I saw Chairman Comer come out and say oversight is going to have a hearing [on UAPs]. I support the Chairman. I think there are important questions to ask… if there are things the federal government is holding back from the American people, the American people have a right to know.”
- D Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, asked about Grusch’s claims: “I have no idea, so I’m going to do the work and analyze it and figure it out… We need to look into whether there are rogue SAP programs that no one is providing oversight for. The goal for me will be to have a hearing on that at some point so we can assess if these SAP’s actually exist.”
  - She is sponsoring an NDAA amendment to mandate that no money can be spent on SAP’s unless it’s been reported to Congress. “So if there are SAPs out there that are somehow outside of the normal chain of command and outside the normal appropriations process, they have to divulge that to Congress.”
- R House majority leader Steve Scalise: “Obviously, we’re concerned about Congress being kept in the dark from a lot of these agencies,”
- R Sen. Josh Hawley: “The takeaway from [the spring’s UAP briefings] is, they had thousands of sightings of these things over the years, which was news to me. So I’m not surprised, necessarily, by these latest allegations, because it sounds pretty close to what they kind of grudgingly admitted to us in the briefing,” Sen. Hawley said. “It’s not good. None of it’s good. I think we want to get to the bottom of this. I think it’s disturbing.”
- Washington Examiner: “R House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner has expressed skepticism as to what Grusch is alleging. As a member of the Gang of Eight, Turner receives briefings on the most sensitive U.S. military and intelligence efforts. That he does not appear to believe Grusch would appear to suggest that Grusch’s classified testimony to Congress has either not been corroborated or that Turner has not received adequate briefings.”
  - “This reflects a deeper concern… that numerous people in the military, intelligence community, and Congress who have the clearances and credible mission-need-to-know about a UFO exploitation program apparently do not know about it. This could be because of the conspiracy that Grusch alleges or because such a program does not exist.”

## Michael Shellenberger: Additional Sources Confirm Grusch’s Claims

- “Multiple sources close to the matter have come forward to say that Grusch’s core claims are accurate. The individuals are all either high-ranking intelligence officials, former intelligence officials, or individuals who we could verify were involved in U.S. government UAP efforts for three or more decades each. Two of them have testified, including as recently as last year, to both AARO and Congress.”
- The individuals said they had seen or been presented with “credible” and “verifiable” evidence that the U.S. government, and U.S. military contractors, possess at least 12 or more alien space crafts.
  - “I know of at least 12-15 craft,” said one person. “Every five years, we get one or two recovered for one reason or another, from either a landing or that we catch, or they just crash.”
- The sources shared their evidence with AARO, which AARO has refused to provide to Congress. The reason AARO “has not discovered any verifiable information,” they said, is because it does have the authority to verify it and may not want to verify it.
- The sources all expressed anger and frustration at the Pentagon’s denial of the existence of nonhuman craft and materials. “The denials coming out of Susan Gough and the Pentagon are specifically chosen to use AARO as the source of information when Grusch has already addressed that AARO didn’t have access. And so, of course, they didn’t discover anything.”
- The sources differed on whether the U.S. was able to operate them. “As far as I know, we are not able to operate them,” said one person, who said they were last briefed on the crashed craft five years ago. “There are people who say we have reverse-engineered them and are flying them. I never found any support for that. And found a lot of support for saying we can’t figure it out. If we do, it would be in some program at a higher security level.”
