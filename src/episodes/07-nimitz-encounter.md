In 2004, the USS Nimitz carrier group tracked hundreds of anomalous radar signals while preparing for a training exercise. Commander David Fravor, flying an F/A-18 Super Hornet, was dispatched to investigate one signal and encountered an unusual flying craft he described as the “tic-tac.” This incident was discussed in the 2017 New York Times coverage of the Pentagon’s UAP office, including the now-famous “FLIR” video. Today we’re going to discuss the incident in detail, and why it marks a turning point in the UFO conversation.
