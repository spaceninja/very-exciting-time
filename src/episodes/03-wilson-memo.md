The Admiral Wilson Memo — aka, The Wilson-Davis Notes, The Core Secrets Memo, etc — is a document that records an alleged conversation between astrophysicist Dr. Eric Davis and Admiral Wilson, the recently retired director of the DIA. They discuss Wilson’s attempts to locate a secret UFO program in the military, which he found, and was denied access to. The document is controversial to say the least, but the story is fascinating, and if it’s true, reveals the existing of a secret crash retrieval and reverse engineering program!
