We’ve got a jam-packed episode for you today. In addition to our planned topic, we open by discussing the news that the US has shot down a Chinese spy balloon, as well as two other UFOs! After discussing why they’re likely balloons, but that’s still interesting for the UFO community, we get to the main topic:

The 2001 Disclosure Project press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, DC. At this conference, Dr Steven Greer (who has become a controversial figure in the UFO community) brought over 20 military, intelligence, and government witnesses together to testify to what they know about UFO incursions in our airspace, and the off-the-books crash retrieval programs hidden in from proper government accountability.

It’s gonna be a wild ride!
