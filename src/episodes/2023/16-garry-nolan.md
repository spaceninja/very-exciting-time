Dr. Garry Nolan, a well-respected Standard immunologist, was interviewed recently at a financial conference about UFOs. He said some fascinating things about UAP, the government’s response, what they might be, and how to destigmatize the topic to encourage scientists to take it seriously. He also mentioned that a recent whistleblower testimony “created quite a hornet’s nest in Washington!” We’ll talk about Garry’s background, and why we find him credible.
