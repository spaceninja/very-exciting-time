We’re opening the show with a bit of a bummer, because Schumer’s UAP disclosure amendment in the NDAA failed. Some UAP language remains, but it’s been severely watered down to the point of being perhaps useless, but Lue Elizondo reassures us that there’s a plan B in the works. Ross Coulthart interviewed Retired Navy Admiral Tim Gallaudet, who says plainly that we’re in contact with a non-human intelligence. And lastly, David Grusch dropped some big news: He’s just gained security approval to reveal that he has firsthand knowledge from being read into a UAP program, and is going to release an op-ed in the coming weeks.

## UAP Disclosure Amendment Failed

- The final NDAA resolution did include some UAP language, but it stops way short of what Schumer’s amendment originally called for, completely removing the eminent domain clause and the JFK-style review board.
  - The final bill requires the national archives to create a collection of government documents (both classified and unclassified) that “pertain to unidentified anomalous phenomena, technologies of unknown origin, and non-human intelligence.”
  - All of the covered records are to be released 25 years after creation, except cases in which the President or the government agency that created the record decide it would be a security risk.
- Daniel Sheehan, famous lawyer, involved in the Watergate and Pentagon Papers cases: “While this UFO/UAP provision of the NDAA would be a significant achievement, gone from the legislation are several crucial features. First, there is no longer an independent review board with subpoena power to compel the transfer of information from Executive Branch agencies and private companies. Second, information newer than 25 years old may be withheld by the agencies in possession of it, e.g., the Central Intelligence Agency, with no entity capable of overruling that decision. Third, there is no eminent domain authority to mandate the return of UFO/UAP technologies currently in the hands of private aerospace defense contractors to the government. Lastly, the distribution of oversight responsibility to six distinct committees in Congress doesn’t provide an adequately centralized authority to overrule agencies that wish to keep information secret.”
- Rep Burlison: “Ultimately, this disclosure language is a gutted, watered down version of what the American people deserve. It won’t bring us any closer to UAP truth. The remaining provisions are net negative and work against transparency. Without clear definitions of terms and enforcement mechanisms, the so-called 'intelligence agencies' can continue hiding the truth from us.”
  - Unlike Schumer’s original amendment, in the final text, terms like NHI aren’t defined, which leaves it up to the archivist to define them.
- Rep Burchett: “We got ripped off. We got completely hosed. They stripped out every part.”
- Sen Schumer and Sen Rounds, the sponsors of the UAP disclosure amendment, engaged in a colloquy on the Senate floor to express how frustrated they are:
  - Schumer: "We've been notified by multiple credible sources that information on UAPs has also been withheld from Congress, which if true is a violation of laws requiring full notification to the legislative branch, especially as it relates to the four congressional leaders, the defense committees, and the intelligence committees."
  - The two of them went back and forth for a bit, discussing how their disclosure amendment was modeled on the JFK records act, and how it would have addressed the lack of trust and transparency.
  - Schumer: “It is an outrage the House didn’t work with us on our UAP proposal for a review board. This means declassification of UAP records will be up to the same entities that have blocked and obfuscated their disclosure for decades. We will keep working to change the status quo.”
- Chris Mellon, former deputy assistant secretary of defense: “It is heartening to see prominent members of the Senate reiterating their support for legislation to provide greater accountability and transparency on the UAP issue. There is no doubt in my mind that critical information on this important subject is still being withheld from Congress and the public.”
- Marik Von Rennenkampff, former DOD analyst: “The most important - and telling - takeaway of all of this may be that opposition to the Schumer-Rounds UAP Disclosure Act was led by two politicians with deep, two-way ties to the defense industry (including one whose district includes the base that housed Project Blue Book).”
- Lue Elizondo, former head of AATIP: “Have no fear. We already have a plan B, plan C, and so forth. We now know where the vulnerabilities of the beachhead lie and where the incoming fire is from. This is extremely important and valuable for disclosure.”
- Richard Dolan, UFO researcher: “So what I am saying is, just like the whole Sean Kirkpatrick hearing in April of this year backfired and arguably led to the appearance of someone like David Grush to really just give that position the ultimate smackdown, so too the gutting of the UAP Disclosure Act in this NDAA may well also backfire. If they were afraid of catastrophic disclosure erupting, they just may have lit the fuse.”

## Ross Coulthart Interviews Ret. Adm. Tim Gallaudet

- Retired Navy Admiral and former head of NOAA Tim Gallaudet was interviewed by Ross Coulthart on NewsNation, where he firmly backed Grusch’s claims.
- Gallaudet: “We're being visited by nonhuman intelligence with technology we really don't understand, and with intentions we don't understand either.”
  - Coulthart: “I think the intransigence by the house republicans to stopping the UAP disclosure legislation is just going to force greater public disclosure. Because there is impatience at the highest levels of the military that this is a safety and national security issue that needs to be urgently addressed. When you see a Rear Admiral, Retired, at the caliber of Tim Gallaudet making those statements, I find it quite sobering.”
- He repeats the story we’ve heard before about receiving the “gofast” video in a flight safety email on a secure computer that was later removed from the system, citing this as evidence of a cover-up.
- When asked about why he believes there’s a coverup: “This is technology we're still trying to learn about, and it could give us an advantage in any military conflict. So that's a good reason to not disclose the nature of the technology. We don't want to release and disclose all of the technology we have recovered. However, I think it's about time that we do disclose that we are in contact with non-human intelligence. That's what needs to be put out there in the public.”
- When asked why people in the government say there’s no credible evidence: “What you have going on right now are, again, Legacy classified programs, Special Access Programs, and without Congressional direction and White House policy, that’s not gonna change.”

## David Grusch Interviews

- Grusch has been getting interviewed all over the place, including NewsNation, Tucker Carlson, and Joe Rogan.
  - He repeated the bit about knowing people who got read into the program and were upset to discover it was illegal, but there are severe consequences for speaking up.
  - He also reiterated his claim that he and his wife were threatened, saying  “They showed my wife and I they can touch me at any time. Two times.”
  - But there were a couple very interesting bits in his NewsNation interviews:
- Responding to Avi Loeb and Neil DeGrasse Tyson wanting more evidence: “I understand he wants to see proof. Unfortunately, I can't do that because I need to abide by the law. I'm not here to go to jail. So we have a true transparency issue and I think [they need] to lobby the USG for transparency, because the astronomy and astrophysics community is being, unfortunately, degraded and destroyed by not providing this information broadly to be studied by highly-qualified experts like him and other physicists of high repute.”
- On NewsNation, responding to claims he has no firsthand knowledge: “I couldn’t be very upfront about my firsthand knowledge until recently. I got some other security approvals through the prepublication security review process. I did have some firsthand knowledge of some specific parts of the program. I’m currently drafting an op-ed that I’m going to release in a few weeks, and I’ll be discussing what I actually do know firsthand. I just couldn’t discuss that overtly at the time, including at the hearing, because the Pentagon and the IC were sitting on some of my prepublication review paperwork at the time, so I could not acknowledge that. The deeper description of what I know has been redacted, they proposed a redaction in a prepublication security review response a few days ago and they’re telling me to withhold legally some of the firsthand knowledge that I have, but I’m allowed to generally discuss that I was read into a UAP-related program directly by the US government.”
  - Ross Coulthart said he didn’t know what will be in the op-ed, but speculated it could be about some photos or videos that Grusch saw.
