The SALT conference invited Karl Nell to speak to an audience of high-powered investors about non-human intelligence on Earth, which Nell said he has “zero doubt” is happening. He also discussed what disclosure might look like, why the government might be reluctant to disclose, and why they should do it anyway, as well as explaining why “catastrophic disclosure” could lead to societal collapse!

## Who is Karl Nell?

- Last year, we talked about Garry Nolan speaking at SALT iConnections NYC, which they describe as their “annual flagship Wall Street conference, bringing together the world’s leading investors, entrepreneurs and policymakers for curated capital introductions and onstage content. The agenda will focus on themes surrounding disruptive innovation in finance, economics and geopolitics…”
  - Nolan spoke to a room full of high-powered investors, and told them that he was “100% confident” that an extraterrestrial intelligence was visiting our planet.
  - Well, this year, they kept the ball rolling. At first they announced that David Grusch would be speaking, but he fell through due to a scheduling conflict, so they ended up getting Karl Nell to speak.
- SALT bio: “Colonel Karl E. Nell is an Aerospace Executive, Senior Military Officer & Corporate Strategist. An Ivy League graduate, certified-PMP®, published author, War College alumni, and fully Joint-qualified commissioned officer in the Army Reserve, Karl has been honored to command at every grade level through colonel including activation of the Army’s newest expeditionary military intelligence brigade supporting XVIII Airborne Corps and JSOC.”
- We first heard about Nell in the Debrief article that Leslie Kean and Ralph Blumenthal wrote about David Grusch in June of last year:
  - The Debrief: “Karl E. Nell, a recently retired Army Colonel and current aerospace executive who was the Army’s liaison for the UAP Task Force from 2021 to 2022 and worked with Grusch there, characterizes Grusch as ‘beyond reproach.’”
  - Nell was quoted as saying “\[Grusch’s\] assertion concerning the existence of a terrestrial arms race occurring sub-rosa over the past eighty years focused on reverse engineering technologies of unknown origin is fundamentally correct, as is the indisputable realization that at least some of these technologies of unknown origin derive from non-human intelligence.”
  - The Debrief article also included this quote: “In a 2022 performance evaluation, Laura A. Potter, Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence… described Nell as ‘an officer with the strongest possible moral compass.’”
- Nell was one of the speakers at the SOL Foundation conference back in November, who had a slide about disclosure that everyone was talking about.
  - At the SOL Foundation, Nell’s talk was about two things. First, he spent most of his time talking about the Schumer UAP Disclosure amendment, which was frustrating, since it ended up getting gutted. Then the second half of his talk outlined a possible plan for disclosure. He said “Disclosure is a process, not an event, and it’s going to stair-step across these phases.”
  - Phase 1 had a goal of government acceptance by January 2024, and he argued this had already happened, with two members of the Gang of Eight pushing forward the UAP Disclosure amendment.
  - Phase 2 had a goal of academic acceptance by January 2026. We shared a quote from Garry Nolan at the time, talking about how the attitude in academia already seems to be shifting to be more open to the idea of UAP, and that was a driver behind his creation of the SOL Foundation.
  - Phase 3 had a goal of public acceptance by October 2030, and would involve a shift in UAP work from being done by the government to being handled in the humanities, scientific investigations, and the private sector.
  - He argued that while there were reasons not to disclose, they left us at risk of disclosure happening in an uncontrolled way. “We want disclosure, but we want to get it through a controlled process that doesn’t create societal collapse.”

## Karl Nell at SALT

- “So, non-human intelligence exists, non-human intelligence has been interacting with humanity. This interaction is not new, and it's been ongoing, and unelected people in the government are aware of that. There’s zero doubt.”
- **Why does he believe that?** “We can look at some folks that have very high-level access to information and said the same thing.” Then he listed Paul Hellyer, the former Defense Chief for Canada, Haim Eshed, the former head of Israel’s Space Force, Chris Mellon, the former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Intel, Lue Elizondo, the former head of AATIP, and David Grusch, the UAP whistleblower, who Nell noted was “cleared for presidential-level material.” And finally, he mentioned there are two members of the Gang of Eight, Marco Rubio and Senator Chuck Schumer, who signed the UAP Disclosure amendment “that basically said they’re not being told the truth, and we need to push forward on that.”
- **Why does the government claim there’s no evidence of extraterrestrials?** “So there's six basic reasons why the government might not want to formally disclose. There's a national security reason. There's the lack of a plan. There's the potential for societal disruption. There's the possibility that there's some non-public agreement. There's the potential for misdeeds and the desire to cover up misdeeds. And there's just the basic organizational intransigence and lack of priority that might be associated with the topic.”
  - “So all these things are factors. The issue is that really the national security issue subsumes all the others. And so there's an opportunity maybe to contract the national security issue similarly to what was done with nuclear weapons and nuclear energy, such that nuclear energy is not necessarily classified and is available to the public.”
  - “But lack of a plan and the potential for societal disruption are key ingredients that would prevent any responsible leader from coming forward with information that they don't have the means to address in a responsible way. It would be irresponsible to do that.”
- **Asked if he’s opposed to disclosure** “So there's really three reasons that trump all those others.”
  - “The first issue is the moral right. The government exists for and by the people. And so the nature of reality is fundamentally not government information. People have a right to know the world in which we live, and the pursuit of happiness requires that knowledge. But as a corollary to that, if there are misdeeds that were done, then they need to be remediated. If there's lack of proper oversight, which is suggested by some of the whistleblowers, that needs to be remediated.”
  - “The second issue is being in a reactive mode is never preferable to being in a proactive mode. So a reactive mode is basically trying to prevent disclosure. But failing that, you might get a situation where you have catastrophic disclosure that creates all the problems that you were trying to prevent. So a more balanced middle path of control disclosure is the best way to do this, which is, again, an argument for some amount of disclosure.”
  - “And the third part is simply societal advance and global competitiveness. More brain trust needs to be brought into this topic in order to make progress and to improve society. And so all three of those things together trump the six other reasons for non-disclosure.”
- **What does disclosure look like?** “\[Disclosure\] is usually thought of as a binary state. It's like an all or nothing. But anybody paying attention realizes the government has already indicated that unidentified anomalous phenomena are real. They're not ours, and they're not our adversaries. The Pentagon has said that. For people that are paying attention, that shoe already dropped. So for a lot of people, they think that the second shoe to drop is this is non-human intelligence.”
  - “And maybe the conversation stops there. The president comes out and says there's non-human intelligence. The truth is that that will precipitate this crescendo of other questions that maybe the government's not ready to answer. That will court, if not precipitate, potential negative ramification for society.”
- **How could uncontrolled disclosure lead to societal collapse?** “And so as an example of this, I would actually point to something from the ancient past, the Bronze Age collapse. So Eric Klein, Princeton University, 2015, wrote a very interesting book called 1177 BC, ‘The Year that Civilization Failed’. Within a single lifetime, all of the very effective ancient civilizations of the Bronze Age failed due to a confluence of reasons that are not necessarily fully understood today.”
  - “So we're talking about Egypt, the Hittite Empire, the Minoan Empire, the Minasian Empire, the Babylonian Empire. All these civilizations failed never to return, other than, let's say, Egypt. And so these were highly sophisticated civilizations with highly developed infrastructures, highly developed administrative states. They were globalists, in a sense, very similar to today in terms of the known world, the known near east. They were economically interdependent. They had both diplomatic ties and commerce ties. And yet these civilizations failed in a single lifetime because of stressors that these civilizations collectively could not address within the time frame.”
  - “And so if we look at our society today, one might argue that it's similarly fractured, similarly under economic stress, similarly under cultural stress as well, fractured and fragile, diplomatic situation. It mirrors very much this scenario. And so for a responsible decision maker, that is certainly a factor.”
- **Is disclosure was inevitable?** “I would suggest that maybe the peak of this current cycle happened last December with the Schumer Amendment, and then it got rolled back and was defeated in the House. And so it remains to be seen if the process is good to continue.”
  - “One hopes and can maybe draw a little bit of confidence that maybe this will come around, is the colloquy that Senator Schumer and Senator Rounds had back in December. After their amendment got killed, they basically went on the Senate floor and articulated their rationale for the legislation. And I think Senator Schumer, to quote him, almost said it was a travesty that this did not pass.”
  - “So this is a bipartisan colloquy on a topic that I guess most people would probably consider fringe. And yet these two senators felt the need to do that and to double down on their desire to see this through. So hopefully we'll see maybe a reintroduction of some version of that this summer with the goal of maybe putting it into the NDAA by the end of the year.”
  - Matt Lazlo of Ask a Pol spoke to Sen Rounds this week and he confirmed that negotiations were happening regarding the UAP Disclosure amendment in the next NDAA.

## Reactions

- Retired Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet: “My colleague, retired Army Colonel Karl Nell, gave an exceptional interview at the recent SALT conference. His topic was UAP, formerly UFOs, and he said with 100% certainty that the world is being visited by higher level, non-human intelligence (NHI). I know he is correct with complete certainty.”
- Matthew Pines, director of security advisory at Sentinal One, said “Those digesting Karl Nell’s remarks today should understand that he wasn’t trying to _convince_… he was trying to get that elite professional audience _prepared_. These folks are used to strategic comms as a mix of overt and implied signaling. His message came through clear.”
