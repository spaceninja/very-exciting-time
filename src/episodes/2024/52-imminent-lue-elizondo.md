Lue Elizondo’s new book: _Imminent: Inside the Pentagon's Hunt for UFOs_ is finally out, and it’s jam-packed with fascinating information. Broadly speaking, Lue confirms David Grusch’s allegations about an illegally hidden UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program, but he also gets into the back story about how AATIP split from AAWSAP under his direction, how he left the Pentagon for TTSA, and how he and Chris Mellon have worked with Congress to advance disclosure. He also discusses his experience training as a remote viewer for Project Stargate, encountering orbs in his own home, how UFOs work, and even alien implants!

  - “This is no longer a theoretical challenge, it is now a technological challenge.”
- Lue took over AATIP due to religious objections to Skinwalker Ranch investigations
  - Skinwalker ranch paranormal research was scientific but deeply controversial

  - Initial unclassified UAP report, creation of AARO, UAPDA
  - Constant sabotage attempts by Pentagon (implied to be Legacy program), led to weird language and bulletproof definitions
