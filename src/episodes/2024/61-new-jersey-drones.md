Last year, mysterious drone swarms targeted Navy ships and Langley Air Force Base, nearly colliding with an F22 and causing a fighter squadron to be relocated. Despite intense investigation, their origin is still unknown. This year, the drones are back! This time they’re targeting several RAF bases in the UK as well as the entire state of New Jersey. They’ve been in the air every night for over two weeks. These drones are unusually large and quiet, and they can hover in place for hours at a time. Countermeasures are ineffective, and no one’s been able to track where they come from or go to. What is happening?

## 2019 Colorado Drone Swarms

- War Zone: “In late December 2019, The War Zone reported on… fleets of unidentified drones operating in the airspace above northeastern Colorado and western Nebraska. There was a sense of near-panic as law enforcement agencies were inundated with scores of reports of these drones, prompting the creation of a task force that included the FAA, federal law enforcement agencies like the FBI, and sheriffs from multiple Colorado counties. Eventually, the State of Colorado sent one of its well-equipped surveillance planes to hunt for the drones… Despite the large effort and the mobilization of Colorado’s infrared camera-equipped aircraft, nothing conclusive was identified and, to date, no one has come forward to claim responsibility for the drone activities.”
- Jan 17 Air Force press statement: “We can confirm that the drones spotted in Colorado and Nebraska are not from F.E. Warren Air Force Base and are not affiliated in any way with the United States Air Force. We have provided this information to the FAA, FBI, and state and local authorities, as they investigate this matter. The drones have not posed a threat to any of our sites, facilities or operations.”
- The Hill: “The sheriff of Washington County, Colorado… was one of many law enforcement officials who observed the objects. Importantly, he ‘could not confirm what he saw was drone activity because he could not hear a noise from the motor.’ In another incident, internal FAA emails describe an object ‘flying low [but] no engine-propeller noise could be heard.’ One of the unknown objects also passed just 200 feet over a Kansas Highway Patrol officer. Somehow, the brightly lit craft “made absolutely no sound at all, even though the wind was calm.’ Yet another witness, a retired meteorologist, heard ‘no sound’ as one of the objects ‘hovered,’ alarmingly, ‘over a [nuclear] missile command station within sight of his farm.’”
- The Hill: “The objects… often displayed bright flashing white, red and green lights “not consistent with standard aircraft signal light patterns.’ The silent, flashing objects flew only at night. The flashing lights, it should be noted, would be odd if the incidents involved any kind of foreign intelligence gathering operation.”
- The Hill: “Some of these objects also reportedly flew in ‘adverse weather conditions,’ including ‘hovering’ in winds of ‘30 mph with 40-plus mph gusts.’ A briefing document prepared for the FAA administrator noted that sheriffs from several Colorado counties reported that the objects flew for ‘several hours at a time in less than optimum flying conditions (high winds and storm-like conditions).’ By flying against or hovering in strong winds for long durations and emitting no discernable sound, the objects exhibited unique capabilities inconsistent with conventional drone technology.”
- The Hill: “Perhaps most perplexingly, FAA emails note that ‘there are several reports that indicate the drones are operating in coordination with a ‘Big Drone’ that may be stationary in the area.’ This larger object, according to the emails, ‘also described as a ‘Mother Ship,’ is said to hover while all the others fly around in close proximity.’ In one bizarre incident, a Nebraska deputy sheriff reported ‘observing 30 to 50 [objects] flying independently of each other with a larger ‘mothership’ hovering for hours.’”
- The Hill: “Notably, an FAA spokesman who flew in from Los Angeles to assist with the investigation declined to confirm that the objects were drones. In an email, then-FAA administrator Steve Dickson noted that ‘Not too long ago we would have called these ‘UFO’s.’’ His chief of staff responded, ‘Yep! Now everything is a drone!’”
- Journalist Ross Coulthart: “It’s becoming increasingly clear that the US Air Force and sections of the Department of Defense are using supposed ‘drones’ or ‘balloons’ to implausibly attempt to explain away recent UAP sightings.”

## 2023 Langley AFB Drone Swarms

- Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, Chris Mellon: “unbeknownst to the general public, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Drones, and UAP are already disrupting major military activities, not just overseas, but stateside. For example, in December 2023, operations at Langley Air Force Base were disrupted for weeks by unidentified UAV. The impact was so disruptive that I understand an entire fighter squadron was relocated from the base to Naval Air Station Oceana [in Virginia]. Similar incidents in recent years have occurred at Anderson AFB Guam, various military training ranges off the East Coast, Palo Verde and other nuclear power plants, in Colorado, over a number of US warships underway at sea, and elsewhere.”
- Liberation Times: “The incursions extended beyond December 2023… In January 2024, an F-22 nearly collided with an ‘unidentified object’ over Joint Base Langley-Eustis, forcing the F-22 to alter its flight path.”
- Air Force Gen. Mark Kelly told The Wall Street Journal that at least one of the Langley drones was “roughly 20 feet long and flying at more than 100 miles an hour, at an altitude of roughly 3,000 to 4,000 feet. Other drones followed, one by one, sounding in the distance like a parade of lawn mowers.”
- Sen Mark Kelly, in April: “The drone problem, incursions on military installations have gone up, and it’s a real threat to our national security… In December we saw a large number of drone incidents at Langley, we still don’t know who was behind those… We see consistent incursions around sensitive government facilities.”

## November 2024 RAF Base Drone Swarms

- Liberation Times: “Small unmanned aerial systems were spotted in the vicinity of and over Royal Air Force Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall and RAF Feltwell between Nov. 20 and Nov. 24. ‘The number of systems fluctuated, and they ranged in sizes and configurations. The sUASs were actively monitored and installation leaders determined that none of the incursions impacted base residents, facilities or assets.”
- BBC: “RAF Lakenheath was being prepared to potentially house US nuclear bombs after those weapons were removed from the UK back in 2008.”
  - Washington Examiner: “RAF Lakenheath hosts two F-15E and two F-35A fighter squadrons and is also a forward storage facility for U.S. B-61 nuclear bombs. That makes it a high-value concern for NATO and a possible target for Russia.”
- Liberation Times: “Plane spotters monitoring USAF activities from the affected bases… observed Air Force assets deploying apparent countermeasures.”
  - Liberation Times: “One YouTuber filming from outside RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk stated that he could see lights of apparent drones ‘skimming the tops of trees’ near the base and that F15s had taken off and were going ‘round and round above us’.”
  - Chris Sharp: “There are local residents around the base who tell me they are worried. They know the bases are on high alert and can see the heightened police presence.”
  - Chris Sharp: “There is a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) for multiple military aircraft to operate without lights out of Lakenheath until 4 December.”
- Chris Sharp, quoting a witness: “Currently flying over Brandon, Suffolk and moving around in a large circle back & forth from base at varying altitude. Started with white light, then moved to solid red lights & then onto green & red lights. Sound can be heard when directly overhead that sounds like a dull humming engine but almost definitely not a jet engine of any kind.”
  - Liberation Times: “With wind speeds reaching up to 65 miles per hour in the area over the weekend, operating drones in such conditions would likely have been challenging.”
- Chris Sharp: “Drone activity like this takes a lot of coordination and sophistication. To evade UK and U.S. forces for seven nights in a row and through a huge storm is certainly not easy. So my guess is that the operators and technology are advanced. It reminds me of Langley all over again.”
- UAP News: “A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said it did not appear that the drones were the work of hobbyists and appeared to be coordinated, but added that the U.S. military would continue to investigate.”
  - BBC confirmed: “Defence sources have told the BBC that suspicion had fallen on a "state actor" being responsible for the incursions.”

## December 2024 New Jersey Drone Swarms

- The War Zone: “The U.S. Army’s Picatinny Arsenal in northern New Jersey is working with local, state, and federal partners to obtain more information about mysterious drone activity over the facility and in the surrounding area.”
- NJ.com: “For weeks, drones have been flying at night over… New Jersey, sometimes traveling in groups, leaving residents frustrated at the lack of information. Nancy Read… [said] that she has been seeing groups of drones for long periods of time between 8 and 10 p.m… ‘One is stationary, the others are in and out of the tree line… It’s strange. They’re out there for hours, never during the day.’ Mike Walsh… first heard the drones overhead Nov. 18. He’s seen them daily since… He estimated the larger ones were the size of a car. One night he drove over to a ridge… where he counted eight drones flying at once.”
- NBC anchor Hallie Jackson: “This is so bizarre. The TL;DR is ‘large drones fly over towns all night in the middle of the night and nobody knows where they’re from.’”

### Government Response

- Gov Phil Murphy: “[On Dec 4] I convened a briefing with Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas, senior officials from the DHS… and NJ State Police, and members of our congressional delegation to discuss reported drone activity over parts of North and Central New Jersey. We are actively monitoring the situation and in close coordination with our federal and law enforcement partners on this matter. There is no known threat to the public at this time.”
  - Reps Tom Kean and Mikie Sherril released similar statements.
- NJ Sen Douglas Steinhardt: “Today I delivered this letter to Gov Murphy demanding he organize & convene a Joint Legislative session where all 120 members of the State Legislature may ask questions & demand answers from State and Federal authorities into the ongoing reports of unexplained drone activity over our military installations, critical infrastructure & residential communities. None of us should accept the continued stonewalling by our leaders & lack of transparency & accountability from our governments”
  - “With all due respect, dismissing the ongoing and credible reports of drone sightings as ‘nothing’ and ‘no threat’ without offering detailed explanations as to how and why those conclusions were reached is not only dismissive—it is irresponsible and dangerous… As Commander-in-Chief of the New Jersey National Guard, you bear the responsibility of safeguarding our state assets and protecting our communities. Yet, your office has shown no discernible action to address these reports, provide assurances to the public, or explain why such measures are unnecessary. This inaction raises questions about your office's commitment to transparency and public safety. By failing to address these issues publicly and thoroughly, your administration is fostering an environment ripe for conspiracy theories, misinformation, and public panic-conditions that could escalate into dangerous confrontations and further erode confidence in your leadership and ours.”

### FAA Flight Restrictions

- NJ.com: “On [Nov 22], the FAA said it had restricted drone flights temporarily over Picatinny Arsenal, where unauthorized flyovers were reported last month, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster… The FBI requested the flight restrictions ‘out of an abundance of caution.’”
- NBC New York: “Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis saying today that she is asking the FAA to impose a temporary drone flight restriction over the entire borough of Staten Island.”
- NJ.com: “Amid a string of unexplained night-time drone flights over New Jersey, a medevac helicopter was unable to pick up a seriously injured patient last week due to drones hovering near the landing zone.”

### FBI Investigating

- NJ.com: “The FBI is asking for the public’s assistance in unraveling the mystery of dozens of recent nighttime drone sightings… After two weeks of reports of drones flying at night over northern New Jersey, often in groups, the bureau publicized a phone number and website for gathering more reports related to the recent sightings.”
- NBC: “The airspace is the FBI’s domain. When the FAA sees something that is a potential violation of federal law as it pertains to the sky, that’s a time where the FBI would get involved, especially if we’re dealing with multiple counties, and we’re talking about something that could have come from outside New Jersey… they want to have the ability to expand this investigation.”
- NJ.com: “Law enforcement officials from Morris and Somerset counties… issued a statement urging people to send the FBI videos and photos of mystery drones they see in the area.”
  - “While we currently have no evidence or information to indicate these drones pose an imminent threat at this time, their presence appears nefarious in nature. We are asking that all residents be vigilant and report any drone sightings directly to the FBI at the phone number or email tip lines listed below. Photographs and video are specifically requested and can be uploaded to the email address tip line.”
- Fox news, Retired Army Lt. Col. Chuck DeVore: “Some of the FBI agents that have been assigned to look into this have reported drones flying over their homes, as if to say ‘hey, we know where you are.’”

### Police Statements

- Fordham Park Police Chief: “You may have observed or become aware of the various reported drone sightings, in the airspace above Morris County, in recent weeks. Morris County law enforcement, in conjunction with our State and Federal partners, have been attempting to determine the launch point and landing location of these drones, as well as the people or entities responsible for their presence in our airspace. Several drone sightings have been reported above critical infrastructure such as water reservoirs, electric transmission lines, rail stations, police departments and military installations. Members of the local law enforcement community have been pressuring our partners for answers regarding this activity as their presence around our critical infrastructure is concerning.”
- Mark Chiarolanza, spokesman for the Morris County Sheriff’s Office: “‘It’s a complete mystery.’ He added it is unlikely the drones belonged to a recreational group, given that some were reported to be the size of a small car. ‘The best way we’re going to figure this out is if somebody can get a good solid picture of these things. We can’t knock these things out of the sky. That’d be  dangerous.’”
- Evesham Chief of Police Walt Miller, describing the drone sightings in the area: “They weren't like the normal drone that somebody would purchase and use in their home. They were large. Some were described as as large as an SUV, with blinking lights on them. We have no information of who the drones belong to, or what their purpose was… They seem to be larger than the hobbyist, and due to the number of them as well, we would classify them as most likely not a hobbyist that's out doing these… Last night was interesting, just because of the wind that was present. One of those small hobbyist drones wouldn't be able to fly. These larger, I guess, professional drone activity that was out there, gave greater concern, especially in their ability to navigate the weather… They have to be landing somewhere. They're very large, and I know we're working with state police and federal authorities to try to figure that out.”
- Anonymous Facebook post claiming to be a leaked internal email from a police department: “Here is the update we received through the FBI and the NJSP: Multiple reports of organized drone activity in Morris, Somerset and Essex County. These events started approximately (2) weeks ago. The drones are varying in size from a little over 1' to over 10 feet wide. Initial intelligence is showing that these are military grade drones that are undetectable by current United States Technology. Blackhawks and other US aircraft have been launched to try and intercept these drones, however when they get into the area, the drones go "dark and disappear." These drones have been reported to be traveling over 100mph and are capable of payload/weapon systems. The battery systems are like nothing we have seen before.”

### Public Eyewitnesses and Video

- Verge: “The drones were captured on camera by residents in multiple boroughs in the state, mostly at night. Some images and videos shared in news broadcasts and social media depict strange winged aircraft that look like small planes (or “car-sized drones”). Others seem like groups of consumer-level drone copters.”
- Ovniologia: “There have been reports of drones hovering over people’s homes for hours on end. Other reports say the drones often cluster in groups of up to eight. Because the drones most often fly at night, it’s difficult to gauge their size, but some describe them as being as big as a small car. There are often flashing lights, usually in a triangular pattern.”
- Pix11 News: “Mike Walsh says he’s seen hundreds of them over the past two weeks from his backyard, and has the video to prove it. ‘They kinda go slow. They’ll come towards you and they’ll change direction a little. They’re all going different ways. They’re not up there for 15 minutes, they’re up there for hours. Some are very big, probably the size of a car.’”
- Phil Doyle, eyewitness: “It’s not like 2 or 3 a night, it’s probably 30 to 50 a night. A lot of them seem to come from the Picatinny Arsenal area, which is just on the other side of the hill.”
- Klaus tweeted repeatedly on the 5th: “About 40 drones flew by our apartment in the past hour.” “Almost looks like an invasion.” “Easily seen 100 drones by now. What the hell is happening.” “It just seems like a drone parade. It’s weird but I haven’t seen anything anomalous.” “I still don’t think people are grasping how many of these things there are. We’re at the highest point in the area, and our bedroom window overlooks their flight path. We might not see them close up, but we see _all_ of them. It’s nuts.”
- Reddit: “With all the hoopla ongoing regarding the NJ drones I decided to pop into the NJ sub to see what the locals have to say. I have to admit, the posts in this sub gave me the impression that the drone sightings were isolated to a few locations. After only 10 minutes of scrolling I quickly realized this is not the case. In the last 24 hours the drones have been sighted by locals in [29] different counties and townships… The important thing to point out here is the scale of these sightings. These drones are being seen over multiple counties simultaneously, sometimes moving in squadron formation. Extreme wind this evening has not affected flight performance of these drones at all according to locals… Patterns have emerged in witness testimony regarding the drones. They include: Appearing as small fixed wing aircraft ranging in size from a small car to school bus size; Observed in groups of 1-10 at a time; Drones are either silent, or sound like a leaf blower or lawn mower when close by; Locals report hearing these sounds ‘buzzing’ their houses multiple times throughout the course of the night.”
- Fox News: “One family in Morris County, who followed a drone in their car, said that as the drone hovered above them, their car's clock changed time and only returned to normal as they drove off.”
  - Reddit: “This is a hallmark of traditional GPS Spoofing technology that is used as a countermeasure against drones, missiles, and conventional aircraft. The question is, is this technology being used in an attempt to bring down these drones? If so it seems to have little to no effect. Alternatively, these drones themselves may be employing GPS spoofing technology in order to disrupt our infrastructure in some way.”

## Drone Countermeasures

- Tommy Turner, member of a drone piloting Facebook group: “Most military bases and sensitive government facilities have sophisticated drone detection and anti-drone technology. While it might be possible to fly over or onto base it is very likely the drone will be disrupted and if controlled locally, the operator's location pinpointed. If the drone(s) are brought down, the resources available to investigate the origin are vast. There are examples of this type of technology at work at the Las Vegas Formula One event.”
  - A company called COPTRZ posted a case study explaining how they were tasked with protecting a Formula One even in the UK: “Multiple radiofrequency and optical forms of detection were used to provide a complete solution to all UAVs. The technology was able to retrieve details on the drones’ serial numbers and model. It also located its route, altitude and speed. It was even able to detect the individuals operating them. This allowed them to inform the organisers of any unplanned flight activity.”
- Liberation Times: “Other countermeasures available to the USAF allow security personnel to take control of drones and safely land them so that personnel can take custody,” as well as “dronebusters,” which they describe as a “handheld non-kinetic mitigation device that can detect groups of one to five UAS and jam signal between drone and controller.”
  - Liberation Times: “Concerningly, one Langley AFB witness stated that their dronebuster ‘failed to register’ one of the objects, while another was unable to use a dronebuster ‘due to not having a visual’.”
- UKUAP: “Most UK counter-UAS (CUAS) systems can detect, track, and identify drones using RF, radar, and optical sensors. These systems often detect communication between the pilot/ground control station and the drone. Likely, the drones in question are autonomous, pre-programmed with waypoints and mission plans. Autonomous operation eliminates active comms or GPS reliance, making jamming ineffective”
- UAP Jedi: “The RAF protect our skies with a QRA (Quick Reaction Alert) squadron based around the UK to intercept foreign adversaries approaching the UK from flying into our airspace. This is augmented by radar stations that can spot these planes/drones from hundreds of miles away. So we should be able to safely say, they haven't flown here from ‘Russia’. Locally launched? If they are, they would have to be relatively small and easily transported, this limits the flight time and range… To do this over several nights with utter impunity suggests a major national security issue at the very least… Even if these are not true UAP, the implications here are terrifying and cannot be understated.”

## Why Not Shoot Them Down?

- Pentagon Spokesperson, asked last month why the Air Force didn’t shoot down the drones: “Any commander of any base has the authority necessary to protect forces, facilities, and infrastructure. I do know that with all of these incursions, given that it’s on US soil, there’s another level of coordination within the interagency that needs to take place, but the commander absolutely has the authority to engage any systems that are a threat to base.”
  - Journalist: “Wouldn’t surveillance or intelligence gathering be a threat to the base?”
  - Pentagon: “This is something that the department continues to analyze.”
- Sen Gillibrand seems to imply that they don’t have authority to shoot them down if they don’t show hostile intent: “If it's over the base — if it's over a sensitive site, I want to create authority for them to take down. An object that doesn't do anything, it's not showing hostile intent but it's a huge national security breach, and so we want to update the law to say this is a huge national security breach and we may take them down on that basis alone. They don't have to shoot at you. They don't have to drop a chemical weapon. They don't have to drop a nuclear weapon. You could just take them down, because they are clearly spying.”
- Pentagon Press Secretary USAF Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder: “Just to put this in context, even here in the US, if there are drones being flown by hobbyists or some other entity, you want to make sure you’re doing due diligence, not only to protect yourself and the safety of others, but also using appropriate measures in order to not inadvertently creating second or third order effects, in other words, potentially harming the civilian communities we operate in and around. Right now, the assessment is that these drones have had no operational or safety impact on our personnel at any of these facilities. We’re keeping a close eye on them… and we’ll take appropriate measures.”

## Who’s Behind This?

### Hobbyists?

- Sen Kelly: “We don’t know who these drones belong to. My suspicion is a lot of its hobbyists, but some of it is also very likely to be foreign nationals that are doing surveillance with low-cost systems that are somewhat expendable. And it's hard to track ‘em. It's also hard to take them down. You could do a lot with a cheap drone. We see that in Ukraine every single day.”
- AskAPol assistant Andrey Beregovskiy: “It's not really that easy to launch a hobbyist drone into a restricted airspace, unless it's a self-crafted quad, consumer drones have a map of all US restricted airspaces and a GPS to track movements into those. My drone won't even launch in the DC restricted airspace or above national parks (I tried lol). So l'm skeptical about this whole ‘hobbyist drone users above our military bases’ stuff.”
- Brett on Twitter: “I unwittingly flew my DJI mini in the vicinity of RAF Menwith Hill a couple of months back whilst doing a parking survey at a nearby business park. My drone was in the air less than 5 minutes and within the hour I had armed police pulling up on me.”
- Justin Malveaux, member of a drone piloting facebook group: “I don't think it's hobbyists… This is much more serious than flying over a stadium. You risk additional federal charges flying over a military installation. That's a risk most won't take.”
- Matthew Pines, Director of Intelligence at SentinelOne: “The sheer number and persistence of the disruptive and mysterious overflights of such a sensitive military base… as well as the manifest failure of deployed Counter-UAS systems… is a serious national security issue… It’s unlikely hobbyist[s] could have controlled this many UAVs.”

### Foreign Adversaries?

- Ross Coulthart: “These alleged drones appear to be operating with total impunity over the US and the UK, over some very sensitive nuclear military facilities. So why would any foreign adversary state power deploy drones with such overt running lights?”
- Former State Dept Analyst Marik Von Rennenkampff: “The multiple, consistent reports of bright, flashing lights and formation flying suggest that some actor - be it a drone operator or otherwise - was putting on a show of impunity, at considerable risk, over a key military facility. If this was a foreign intelligence gathering operation, the brazen nature of the incursions makes it some of the worst collection tradecraft imaginable.”
- UK UAP: “Our adversaries already have access to sophisticated surveillance tools (e.g., satellites) so what would be the purpose behind such a blatant, overt demonstration? If these drones aren't carrying specific payloads for unique purposes, the intent is questionable: Nuisance? Disruption? Show of force? Hostile reconnaissance? Psychological tactics?”
- Chris Sharp: “I can't highlight this enough: If drones or UAP are above the bases… [for] over ten nights of incursions over most sensitive airspace in the UK. The message is clear: The UK and the U.S. are powerless for now and do not control the airspace.”
- Aerospace Engineer Condorman: “When our bases in Syria are attacked with drones, we know exactly where they came from and launch counter strikes. Drones are not that hard to track. Something is amiss here, like it was with the Langley drones. Unless they know where the drones came from and are outright lying.”

### Something Anomalous?

- Ross Coulthart: “Why are Congresspeople being led to the impression that these must be explainable as foreign adversary drones? If it's the Chinese or the Russians, how are they deploying drones over US military facilities undetected? Why have no people been charged? Why  have none of these objects been recovered? The reason why these objects haven't been recovered is because in a large number of occasions, they are genuinely anomalous. That's what I'm being told by my sources, that these do not constitute what you would normally regard as a drone. They don't have propellers, they don't have rockets, they don't have the kind of visible propulsion systems that you'd be used to with a normal commercial military drone. So what the hell are they?”
- Chris Mellon: “Rather than acting like furtive spy craft, these drones are flying brightly lit after dark, seemingly without concern for detection or U.S. countermeasures. Some are even brazenly using spotlights to illuminate and perhaps film U.S. military systems… This behavior suggests that they are either trying to get our attention, trying to send a message, or they are utterly unconcerned by U.S. military countermeasures. Such lack of concern may be reasonable as nothing we have done to date has been effective. That’s right– we’ve not managed to capture, disable, track to its point of origin or identify any of these UAS. Nor do any seem to have malfunctioned, which is also extraordinary given the number of drones in these swarms (sometimes swarms of 40) and the number of incidents and their duration (hours at a time).”
- Matthew Pines: “Frankly every available explanation is problematic: Adversaries making a mockery of our air defense, USG causing a civilian freakout by irresponsibly testing advanced tech over civilian pop, or Non-human origin craft deciding they don’t need to be as stealthy anymore.”
