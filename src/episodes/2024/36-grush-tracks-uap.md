Recently the House Oversight Committee got a classified briefing from the ICIG, which gave them some new information, including locations to investigate. Whistleblower David Grusch gave a private presentation where he said he was part of a secret program to track UAP, and that a US adversary may be trying to force disclosure. Finally, former AARO director Sean Kirkpatrick wrote an article that tries to dismiss Grusch’s claims by teasing the upcoming historical report AARO will release. Hint: it says AARO has found no evidence of extraterrestrials or secret programs. Travis Taylor is unimpressed with Kirkpatrick’s “scientific” approach.

## ICIG Briefing

- On January 12, the House Oversight Committee participated in a classified briefing with the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (ICIG), Thomas Monaheim about whistleblower David Grusch’s claims.
- This follows a similar briefing in October with the Inspector General of the DOD, which Rep Luna said was “pointless,” and Rep Mace described as “one of the most worthless classified briefings I’ve ever attended.”

### Frustrations With Process

- Rep Tim Burchett: “I don’t know. More the same. I'm tired of the runaround. Someone would ask a question, but then they would give a very unanswer-answer. Then somebody else would ask it more specific, and then they would give a better answer. And I’m tired of that stuff, just give us the answer… We shouldn't have to go through that many hoops.”
- Rep Andy Ogles: “I asked VERY specific questions, all of which were dodged or given typical, ambiguous answers… There's a concerted effort to conceal as much information as possible. What you see is an over-compartmentalization of the truth."
- Rep Mike Waltz: “It was very process oriented. We didn’t see anything definitive on the existence of extraterrestrials, but definitely some concerns on whether things are being shared… that should be.”

### ICIG Shared Specific Info

- Rep Jared Moskowitz: “This was the most fascinating meeting I've sat in. This was more directional, right? On where we need to focus and what the next steps are. Where we need to ask for information. Places actually to maybe go.”
  - When asked what sort of new questions he has: ”Let me just give you a hypothetical: If someone (Grusch) makes ten claims, and the someone (ICIG) says, ‘Well, we didn’t look into all ten because they weren’t all in the report. But hey, we found these six very credible, based on it.’ Well then you would wanna go attack those six.”
- Rep Eric Burlison: “There's certain locations that they've provided that we can certainly look into… and hopefully we’ll get access. Although, it appears — based on conversations — that it's not going to be easy to get access.”
- Rep Anna Paulina Luna later tweeted: “I feel confident that we have enough evidence to move forward with our first field hearing. We will be announcing details soon.”
  - Matthew Pines, director of security advisory at SentinelOne, responded, saying “They were told of specific facilities by the ICIG. They will now try to gain access or door-knock.”

### David Grusch Validated

- Rep Eric Burlison: “There's some validation of Grusch’s claims on process… that it's difficult to get information to members of Congress or that information is being withheld… I think that it's been proven what he said, that the information is being compartmentalized and that… there's a culture of fear and intimidation around this.”
- Rep Jared Moskowitz: “The process is extremely frustrating, but this is the first real briefing that we’ve had where  we’ve now made progress on some of the claims Mr Grusch has made… This is the first time we kind of got a ruling on what the IG thinks of those claims. This meeting actually moved the needle… Based on what we heard many of Grusch’s claims have merit!”
- Rep Nancy Mace: “It's actually one of the more productive meetings that we've had so far. Some of the others have been completely irrelevant and useless. This had more utility. A better conversation. And I would say David Grusch was determined to be credible on some of the things that we discussed today.”
- Rep Anna Paulina Luna: “If there was any doubt in anyone’s mind that Grusch isn’t credible… after leaving the briefing, where I’m at is that I feel that he’s a very credible witness.”

## Grusch’s Private Presentation

- David Grusch’s op-ed article isn’t out yet, but while we’re waiting, he recently gave a small private presentation, and we’ve got notes from a Reddit user in the audience.
- They shared notes and a few photos of Grusch next to his slides. They were answering questions for awhile, but then deleted their account. People on twitter were assuming somebody said “Hey that was a private meeting, please delete that.”
- They said they “went to a private 60-person presentation with David Grusch as the speaker. This was mostly all private citizens. As in professors, lawyers, business people, a few scientists, retired military, current FBI, and other government agency members. It was hosted by a wall street big wigs and his lawyer friend. It was sort of a small salon style talk. David also did it for free. In the end, we were allowed to ask questions.”
- “He said he was part of an extremely secret program that figured out how to track and find UAPs in our atmosphere and near earth orbit. He said that this had something to do with a frequency that they can track or some kind of signature. He said his op-ed will include more details about this.”
- “He also mentioned that he had recently been informed that a US adversary was considering full disclosure to get out ahead of the US and that he passed this information along to the US government.”
- He was told about a UAP in US possession “with a diameter of around 40 ft, but once you went inside, it was the size of a football field. They believed that the object was somehow able to manipulate both space and time.”
- “He also said that the object was both using and creating energy that was more than a terawatt when measured.”
- He said “we wouldn't be surprised by what the NHI look like, as they look like the typical grey and they aren't sure where these beings have come from. There is also a chance that they are extra dimensional, but that it could also just seem this way because of the technology they use rather than them being actual extra dimensional beings.”
- “Interestingly, he also mentioned how many people know the full scope of the phenomenon to be no more than 50 people, but it wasn't clear whether this meant 50 people currently alive or 50 people ever in history.”

## Kirkpatrick Article

- Former AARO director Sean Kirkpatrick is back in the news, after writing an article for Scientific American titled “Here’s What I Learned as the U.S. Government’s UFO Hunter.”
- It’s a pretty viciously dismissive summary of what he claims AARO found while preparing AARO’s upcoming “Historical Record Report Volume One,” which is due out later this month.
- He opens like this: “Carl Sagan popularized the maxim that ‘extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.’ This advice should not be optional for policy makers. In today’s world of misinformation, conspiracy driven decision-making and sensationalist-dominated governance, our capacity for rational, evidence-based critical thinking is eroding, with deleterious consequences for our ability to effectively deal with multiplying challenges of ever increasing complexity.”
- He says “the conspiracists’ story goes something like this” and then provides a one paragraph summary of Grusch’s claims without ever mentioning him by name: “During a full-scale, year-long investigation of this story (which has been told and retold by a small group of interconnected believers and others with possibly less than honest intentions—none of whom have firsthand accounts of any of this), AARO discovered a few things, and none were about aliens.”
- “No record exists of any president or living DOD or intelligence community leader knowing about this alleged program, nor any congressional committee having such knowledge.”
- “The report demonstrates that many of the circulating allegations described above derive from inadvertent or unauthorized disclosures of legitimate U.S. programs or related R&D that have nothing to do with extraterrestrial issues or technology. Some are misrepresentations, and some derive from pure, unsupported beliefs.”
- Travis Taylor, the former chief scientist on the UAP task force wasn’t too impressed with Kirkpatrick’s article and commented on his LinkedIn post.
- Taylor: “About this nonsense of "extraordinary claims requiring extraordinary evidence", neither that phrase nor any of those words show up in the scientific method. By making that Saganistic statement you immediately bias the experiment/ method because what you are saying is that you will be throwing out ANY and ALL unextraordinary data/ evidence. Whereas, within the Scientific Method all data and evidence must be considered, investigated, and analyzed. In order to find substantiating evidence, you have to ACTUALLY look.”
- Taylor: “AARO was a farce to shovel the manure back into the manufacturer and the public doesn't realize it. I find it very interesting how SK goes to Scientific American and immediately there's an article claiming "Hey everybody, go back to work cause there's nothing to see here." While myself, and many, many, others are railroaded at the peer review with papers that don't even mention UFOs.”
- Kirkpatrick: “That pretty much proves my point. Rather than produce ANY verifiable and repeatable evidence (something that I believe is in the scientific method), your immediate response is to hearken to unfounded accusations and character attacks. While you may not admire Sagan, the adage is within scientific doctrine, if not spelled out in the method. Searches for such things as the existence of the Higgs Boson, and quantum entanglement, require extraordinary evidence. It's a matter of your definition. So rather than sensationalize in the public sphere, how about do some real science and present the data to the community for verification? Why leap to extraterrestrials when there are many other more salient explanations?”
- Taylor: “I didn't name call or character attack. Don't put that on me. I also NEVER used the word 'extraterrestrial'. I have only ever stated that there are a few possible solutions: 1) Near Peers have leapfrogged us, 2) oligarchs have leapfrogged us, 3) Mother Nature is doing something we've never measured before, 4) something from elsewhere/elsewhen. I didn't 'claim' anything extraordinary. I merely generated categories of solutions sets. And, I might add, the IC pressed hard to have category 4 removed from any documents. And while, as you say, "...the adage is within the doctrine..." that doesn't make it correct. People all the time quote Occam's Razor and never get it right as Sir William of Occam stated it. But 'it is in the doctrine'. The obfuscation of throwing Higgs and QE in the rebut doesn't make your point at all. They did NOT require "extraordinary evidence" what they required was steady stable application of the scientific method.”
