This week we’re covering a selection of UFO-related news. The National Archives extended the deadline for government agencies to turn over their UAP files. Journalists George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell have received credible death threats, and have created dead man’s switches to trigger “catastrophic disclosure” if anything happens to them. The November UAP hearings in both the Senate and the House have been confirmed, and there are claims that the House hearing may center on new whistleblowers related to the Immaculate Constellation story.

## National Archives UAP Deadline Extended
* The 2024 NDAA included a watered-down version of the UAP disclosure act. Although there’s no longer any enforcement mechanism, it did include a law that every government office had to voluntarily turn over any UAP records to the National Archives by October 20, 2024.
* The NARA sent out a memo on October 10 telling agencies they could have until September 30, 2025 (though it did request that they transfer materials on a rolling basis, and as soon as possible).
* But, the National Archives also posted a large collection of new historic UAP reports, including UFO investigations conducted by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations in the 50s and Project Blue Book files.
* It turns out that these were all records that NARA already held before the NDAA passed. Moving forward, they created Record Group 615, the UAP Records Collection, which will handle all records turned over as a result of the NDAA, but so far they haven’t received anything.
* Klaus: “The fact that the National Archives has received zero UAP records proves exactly why we need a records review board with subpoena power.”

## Death Threats and Dead Man’s Switches
* On a recent episode of their podcast about Immaculate Constellation, journalists George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell revealed that they’ve received death threats and have multiple dead man switches:
  * Knapp: “Is there risk in reporting about this? Is there risk in even knowing information? Is there risk in admitting you know more that has not been made public yet?”
  * Corbell: "Yeah. I have been notified of very specific and direct and detailed threats against my life, as well as against anybody who may have information, assets, or contact with additional whistleblowers or individuals who are aware of this program. So much so that I have taken action through law enforcement to make sure that they are aware. I did not put a lot of stock in it and then I called four different people to advise me, and to my shock and awe… was told to take it 100% deadly seriously."
  * Knapp: "Do you have in place what you might call a dead switch, a system whereby information about this and other matters that we've collected over the years, would be disseminated if something were to happen?"
  * Corbell: "Yeah, I will not mince words. We have had in place, for quite some time, unrelated to this story of IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION, that if you or I are removed from the equation, that you have absolute, uncontrolled, catastrophic disclosure of information that would be dangerous to the United States of America, that would be dangerous to global policy, that would be dangerous in many ways. It benefits everybody not to fuck with journalists doing their job."
* Journalist Ross Coulthart has also mentioned that he has a dead man’s switch: “And by the way, if anybody ever did decide to push me under a bus, believe me, every name of every person that I've been told—I haven't been able to verify it [all] so I can't publish it—everything I know will be published by multiple people who I've sent copies of what I have, all around the world. I'm mindful of the fact that I do know people have been murdered. And that's a big call. I know people have been murdered to protect the secret.”

## Immaculate Constellation Followup
* Reddit user Bejammin075: “‘Immaculate’ means clean. ‘Constellation’ means...stars in the night sky. This program gets first dibs on military sensor data, before the data goes anywhere else. If there are any UFOs in that sensor data, they are *immaculately* scrubbed out of the picture or removed from the data stream, so that you don't have any unsightly UFOs ruining otherwise nice pictures of *constellations* in the night sky.”
* Journalist Chris Sharp responded to the Pentagon’s claim that they have no record of any use of the word “Immaculate” for any DOD program, noting that they “did not respond when I asked them to confirm protocols should a legitimate USAP be leaked to the press.”

## Congressional UAP Hearings Not Canceled
* Sen. Gillibrand, confirmed the Senate UAP hearing got moved to November: “Yeah, we are. It’s gonna be an Armed Services hearing.”
* Journalist Mike Disclosure reported that the upcoming House Oversight Committee UAP Hearing, which was scheduled for November 13, might be canceled. “Confidential sources within Congress have informed me that ranking members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Rep. Mike Turner & Rep. Jim Himes are working with high ranking members in the Pentagon to have the upcoming hearings canceled… the recent Michael Shellenberger article about the U.S.A.P. IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION will be a focus in the upcoming UAP Hearing on Nov. 13th. There are several witnesses with direct knowledge of this program who have come forward to Congress. One of the witnesses is expected to testify about the program at the hearing. The Pentagon is trying to pressure Congress due to National Security concerns to cancel the Nov. 13th hearing. Rep. Turner & Rep. Himes are backing the Pentagon in Congress about those concerns.”
* AskAPol reached out to Rep Nancy Mace, the chairwoman of the House Oversight subcommittee on Cybersecurity, who said “Come hell or high water, I’m holding a hearing.”
* AskAPol also got a comment from Rep Himes, who said “I know absolutely nothing about any of this. You should check with Turner who is in the majority. As I think you know, one committee doesn’t generally cancel another committee’s hearings.”
* Douglas Dean Johnson was able to confirm this, getting a quote from an Oversight committee spokesperson: "The Cyber Subcommittee and National Security Subcommittee will hold a joint hearing on UAPs on November 13.”
  * Someone asked Johnson why the Cyber committee, and he said “One might suppose that it is related to the high degree of interest in the subject that has been demonstrated by several of the majority-party members of that subcommittee, including the chair.”
  * He linked to the Cybersecurity subcommittee’s member list, which includes all but one member of the UAP Caucus: Reps Mace, Burchett, Moskowitz, Luna, and Burlison.

## Congressional UAP Hearing Witnesses
* Rep. Burchett, asked about witnesses: “We're trying to get some good witnesses there. We don't want to break them out too early like we did last time and then they get squashed.”
* Rear Adm Gallaudet: “Yesterday I was invited to testify on UAP disclosure before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Accountability in November.”
* Lue Elizondo: “There’s a chance I may be testifying here, soon. I won’t go into details.” And in an earlier interview, he was asked “have you been asked to testify at the upcoming hearing, and if asked, would you?” and Lue responded “Yes and yes.”
* Journalist Jeremy Corbell: “I’ve just returned from several productive in-person meetings and briefings in Washington, D.C., engaging directly with numerous members of Congress and key committees involved in the UAP issue. I can confirm that we are firmly on the right track as we move toward the upcoming UAP hearings. All parties are working tirelessly to shape these proceedings for maximum impact, with a clear focus on public knowledge and transparency. Rep. Mace made it crystal clear when she stated, ‘I need people who’ve maybe seen some sh*t and can tell us some stuff.’ And that is precisely what she and other members will receive. I’ve personally facilitated introductions between whistleblowers and members to ensure that. UAP disclosure is a complex dance, but the music has been playing for a long time - and now, people are finally stepping onto the dance-floor.”
* Corbell: “If people's names aren't leaked, if information isn't leaked, the world will learn about it on November 13th. There is a way in which the world is 100%, no stopping it, going to learn about it on November 13th for the Congressional hearings. Now there's a dramatic way that can happen and an undramatic way. If anybody were to fuck with witnesses or us or anybody involved, it's going to be dramatic. And we don't want that. We want the information out. And if it's the dramatic way, then all of a sudden other people are coming forward too.”
