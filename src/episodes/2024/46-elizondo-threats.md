We open up by sharing a story from two players on the Las Vegas Raiders who say the entire team witnessed a UFO that did not appear on radar while flying home from a game. Then we talk about Lue Elizondo revealing that he and other whistleblowers have received threats, and declares that he is not suicidal. Finally, we get into a juicy bit of drama where Brandon Fugal, the owner of Skinwalker Ranch, claims that Sean Kirkpatrick was in a briefing he delivered to Congress in 2018, and that Kirkpatrick asserted the truth of the UFO phenomenon. Kirkpatrick denied this, but Fugal produced a photo proving Kirkpatrick was there, which raises the question… What else is Kirkpatrick lying about?

## Raiders UFO Sighting

- Maxx Crosby, a player for the Las Vegas Raiders was recently on the Jim Rome show, and was asked about UFOs. “Oh definitely, that’s not even a question. I don’t want anyone coming after me, but that’s public information. It’s real. Like we were literally on a flight back from Miami, and we’ve seen a UFO with our own eyes. And that sounds crazy, but you can ask the pilots, anybody that was there. It was wild. And I seen it, and they had no idea what it was. There was nothing on the radar, nothing. And it was like a big shining light going in and out.”
- Maxx recently invited his teammate Andre James on his podcast, and in the last 30 minutes, they started talking about how Andre is a big conspiracy theorist, so they asked him what he finds most intriguing:
  - “I truly believe that UFOs are here and they have been here for a long time. I'm going to tell a story. So we just played Miami. We're flying back on the team charter plane. On our Charter flights the pilots, if they're cool, let us come up there and talk or whatever. So a few of us are up there, we're just talking to these pilots, like, what do these buttons do, what altitude are we flying at, stuff like that.”
  - “All of a sudden all these pilots are coming on the radio transmitter, like, hey do you guys see those lights out there to the Northeast? They're giving coordinates like 200 South blah blah blah and the pilots are looking at us, like, you guys see anything over here to the left? And we're all three of us kind of looking out there like, no, we don't see nothing, and they're like yeah, they're probably just messing with us, you know, they're probably just bored, you know how pilots get, they're up here flying for hours.”
  - “They're being real laidback with it. So we're looking, we don't see nothing, I go back to my seat. Probably like 20 minutes goes by, I get a text from AJ and he's like hey come up here, we're seeing these lights. And dude, I go up there and immediately I just see like this big white light and it's getting bigger and smaller and bigger and smaller and we're all just like what the hell is that? We're talking to the pilots and like, you know, it could be a satellite. It's just the sun probably bouncing off a satellite. It's probably nothing, we don't know what it is. All of a sudden, this light goes up, down, and it does like a circle, and we're all looking at each other, like, that's not a satellite, and the pilot goes yeah, that's not a satellite, I don't know what that is.”
  - “All of a sudden, another one pops out like right below it, and they're starting to move kinda like side to side. These pilots are looking at each other like, you know, they're still being kind of skeptical. They're like, yeah, we don't know that is. They're like, we're flying at 35,000 feet and whatever that is pretty far above us. So they're being real skeptical still and it was one of the weirdest things I've ever seen and both the pilots are like we've flown 15 years for the military and he's like we've never seen anything like this, really.”
  - “We're like where are we flying, and he was like well we're right in New Mexico, but about 300 miles out that way is area 51, and I was like oh I'm sold. Like, I'm completely sold on this whole conspiracy. What's crazy is like we saw this for probably like 20-30 minutes and dudes were going in and out of the cockpit, I went, Maxx saw it, bro everyone saw it.”

## Threats against Lue Elizondo and other whistleblowers

- The Good Trouble Show, hosted by Matt Ford, which does excellent UFO investigative journalism, recently did a piece on a complicated scandal involving former AATIP director Lue Elizondo’s emails.
  - In a nutshell, when Lue came forward as a whistleblower in 2017, after quitting in protest from his role as director of the Pentagon’s secret UAP program, the Pentagon denied the program existed, and claimed all his emails had been deleted.
  - This was a wild claim, because legally they’re required to retain all of Lue’s emails due to his involvement in the 9/11 commission. They’ve maintained the emails don’t exist in response to FOIA requests, but recently, some of Lue’s emails were leaked on Reddit, and the Pentagon, caught in a lie, grudgingly released that one email, but redacted the word AATIP.
  - Lue Elizondo: “I find it perplexing that the Pentagon redacted the word AATIP from my email.  Two reasons to redact information legally 1: it’s classified. 2: it’s to protect an individual’s privacy.  Neither is the case.”
- Lue Elizondo in a statement to the Good Trouble Show: “To add insult to injury, I was notified yesterday that there may be a personal threat against myself, and several other whistleblowers formerly associated with the UAP effort for the US Government. As such, I would like to make this perfectly clear to the American people: I am not prone to accidents! I am not suicidal! I am not abusing drugs! I am not engaged in any illicit activities. If something happens to me or my family members in the future, you will know what happened!"
- Matthew Pines, security advisor for Sentinal One, said “This must have been no idle threat to warrant someone like Lue—who is a seasoned counterintelligence and counterterrorism officer not prone to paranoia or hyperbole—to make this public statement. Quite concerning, to say the least. Whistleblower protections exist for a reason.”
- Marik Von Rennenkampff, a former DoD official, confirmed the threat against Lue: “I do not post this lightly. I have been made aware of specific, credible threats against Luis Elizondo."
- Garry Nolan, founder of the SOL Foundation, was asked if these threats could stop other whistleblowers from coming forward: “It certainly casts a pall. I know the certain incident that Lue is discussing. It’s real. It’s ongoing. …It’s pretty serious. Look, I got a phone call myself at one point, basically telling me to be careful how I was talking about things. I won’t go into the specifics about what was said, and all the rest, but it shook me. It was a call from somebody in the government, or representing what was being said in certain circles. And it was a threat, and that was the first time I ever felt this was getting personal. It wasn’t a threat by them, it was telling me that the way I was talking about things, I needed to be careful, because there are others who will.”
- Nolan: “[At the SALT conference, I was asked what the best evidence for UFOs.] It’s what your government is doing about it, and the pretzels that they're twisting themselves into to not talk about it or dance around the subject. I mean if there's nothing there release the data I mean that's just a fact if there's nothing there, release the data. Why are you acting so guilty? One of the acts is threatening people. I mean, that's what David Grusch filed his complaint about. He didn't file a complaint to say that there are UAP. That's not a whistleblower. That's not whistleblowing. Whistleblowing is about reporting an illegality. You cannot whistleblow just because you know something, you can only whistleblow if it's an illegality.”
- Ross Coulthart, the NewsNation journalist who introduced David Grusch to the world: “It's very hard to overstate the implications of what Lue has told you today. …I'm amazed he's gone public with it and I'm very happy to see he's finally done this. Because, frankly, I think a lot of this needs to be brought out into the open because a lot of whistleblowers are being intimidated, threatened, and possibly worse.”
- Ross Coulthart casually mentioned during a keynote address that he has a dead man’s switch: “And by the way, if anybody ever did decide to push me under a bus, believe me, every name of every person that I've been told—I haven't been able to verify it [all] so I can't publish it—everything I know will be published by multiple people who I've sent copies of what I have, all around the world. I'm mindful of the fact that I do know people have been murdered. And that's a big call. I know people have been murdered to protect the secret.”

## Brandon Fugal proves Sean Kirkpatrick lied about Skinwalker Ranch briefing

- A brief history of Skinwalker Ranch:
  - Skinwalker Ranch, also known as the “Sherman Ranch” or the “UFO Ranch” is an 512-acre ranch in Utah with a notable history of paranormal activity dating back to the 70s, but gained popular attention from a series of articles by journalist George Knapp in 1996.
  - Robert Bigelow, a real estate developer who would later go on to fund Bigelow Aerospace, and who has had a long interest in UFOs and the paranormal, bought the ranch in 1996 after Knapp’s articles were published.
  - Bigelow’s paranormal research group, the National Institute for Discovery Science, began studying the ranch, which led to a 2005 book called “Hunt for the Skinwalker” by George Knapp and NIDS scientist Colm Kelleher.
    - Defense Intelligence Agency official James Lacatski read the book, visited the ranch, and had a supernatural experience, which he reported to Bigelow.
  - This led to Bigelow’s friend Sen Harry Reid in 2007 appropriating $22 million dollars to start a secret Pentagon research program to study UAP, AAWSAP (Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Application Program).
    - A portion of AAWSAP’s budget was subcontracted to Bigelow for research into UAP and Skinwalker Ranch
    - We found out about the $22 million for AAWSAP in the 2017 NYT article about Lue Elizondo, which unfortunately conflated the AAWSAP and AATIP programs.
  - In 2016, Bigelow sold the ranch to another real estate developer, Brandon Fugal.
  - In 2020 the History channel started a show called The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch investigating the unusual phenomena in the area.
- In April 2023, New York Post journalist Steven Greenstreet interviewed the ranch’s new owner, Brandon Fugal, who claimed that he delivered a briefing in 2018 to the Senate Armed Services Committee about Skinwalker Ranch.
  - Fugal: “We go into this huge briefing room… As we commence the presentation, I was interrupted by a gentleman at the head of the table, and he said, 'Wait. Before we proceed any further, I wanna establish an understanding: All the gentlemen here, Mr. Fugal, that you're presenting to, are all very well aware of the reality of the UFO phenomenon. So please dispense with any part of your presentation that would seek to convince us of the reality, because we already know.’”
  - Greenstreet asks who said that, and Fugal said “One of the individuals leading the discussion,” but Greenstreet later says “A source familiar with this briefing told me this was Sean Kirkpatrick,” which Fugal later confirmed.
  - This was a big deal, because Kirkpatrick told Greenstreet he had no interest or involvement with UFOs prior to becoming director of AARO.
    - Greenstreet: “Seriously, what was he even doing there? How can he say that he had no interest or duties regarding UFOs before 2022, if he's attending briefings in 2018, about one of the most famous UFO spots on planet Earth.”
- A few months later, a Senate Armed Services Committee spokesperson gave a statement: “In 2018, Mr. Fugal updated a handful of Senate staffers on plans for his properties. No Senators were involved and no subsequent briefings were held.”
- A few weeks ago, Greenstreet interviewed Kirkpatrick, who denied the statement about being aware of the reality of UFOs.
  - Kirkpatrick: “No I never said that… I attended a briefing at the request of the Senate Armed Services Committee on what was, at that time, associated with the AATIP/AAWSAP research that was going on, as an independent outside reviewer, and I gave them my opinions at that time… This was not an official government briefing. This was a briefing by people who were not associated with the government.”
  - In a followup answer, Kirkpatrick said: “I ended up at that briefing because a Congressional staffer asked me to attend as an objective 3rd party scientist to listen to the presentation. I did not know it was about Skinwalker Ranch until later. I don’t recall it being referenced by that name during the briefing.”
  - When Greenstreet sent him the powerpoint file for Fugal’s presentation, Kirkpatrick said: “That’s not the briefing I recall seeing. The briefing I saw was less polished. Come to think about it, I don’t believe it was 2018 that I attended a briefing on the Hill. I believe it would have been 2017. In 2018, I was stationed in Colorado. I don’t recall ever meeting Fugal. Maybe he’s confusing the two meetings.”
- The next day, Brandon Fugal tweeted proof that Kirkpatrick was at the briefing.
  - “On April 19, 2018, my team from Skinwalker Ranch was asked to provide a confidential briefing in Washington D.C. to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence & United States Armed Services Committee. Sean Kirkpatrick was at the head of the table.”
  - Included in the tweet was a photo of the briefing room, showing Kirkpatrick at the front of the table, as Fugal is presenting.
    - Fugal notes the photo was taken without permission, but clarified that this was not a classified briefing, just confidential, and that he didn’t sign any NDAs: “There weren’t supposed to be cameras. I instructed our paralegal to discreetly create a record of it in case I needed it in the future.”
  - Twitter rando: “They probably just wanted to meet you and the cast.”
    - Fugal: “There was NO documentary series at the time & it would be several years after this briefing before I would even go public with my identity as the owner of Skinwalker Ranch & the reality of the investigation.”
  - Twitter rando: “Was it made clear to all that Skinwalker Ranch was the scope of the debrief?”
    - Fugal: “Yes, it was crystal clear the sole purpose of the briefing was to provide an update regarding the research activities & data gathered under my ownership of Skinwalker Ranch. There was obviously advance notice & an agenda circulated.”
    - He included several slides from the presentation, which clearly say “Confidential briefing: Skinwalker Ranch”
  - Twitter rando: “Looks more like an afterthought presentation...one of those ‘hey guys, wanna see what I'm working on?’ kinda things.”
    - Fugal: “Definitely not an ‘afterthought’ presentation. We were asked to fly across the country to Washington, D.C. to give a detailed briefing regarding my investigation & research at Skinwalker Ranch. It was 2.5 hrs long with 55 slides plus video. I was accompanied by 3 scientists.”
- Another revelation from Fugal is that his hotel room was broken into. Lt. Tim McMillan asked “Can you confirm that all your prepared presentation materials went “missing” from your hotel room the night before, forcing you to use a backup set for the briefing?”
  - Fugal: “Confirmed. The flash drive containing the briefing was stolen from my room, which was the presidential suite of the Grand Hyatt Washington, D.C., the morning of the briefing, while locked & attending a quick meeting at my Colliers International D.C. office located nearby.”
  - “There were many valuables left in the hotel room at 8am in the morning, including [a stack of] cash next to the flash drive. Nothing was touched but the flash drive.”
  - “I reported the situation to hotel security & front desk. Fortunately (and to my surprise & relief), my principal investigator & scientist, Erik Bard, had saved a copy to his laptop the night before. The briefing was able to proceed.”
- Matthew Pines tweeted “This seems like clear circumstantial evidence Dr. K had UAPs in his portfolio long (at least 4 yrs) before being tapped to head AARO, which cuts against the image portrayed as a neutral scientific & technical intel officer brought in to ‘resolve’ a Congressional requirement.”
  - Garry Nolan replied: “Of the thousands of "experts" who could have been asked, he was asked to be there—you know, just randomly—and then randomly assigned to head AARO. Oops.”
- Adam Goldsack tweeted: “Woke up this morning to Brandon Fugal taking a flame thrower to the entire debunker troll syndicate.”
  - Fugal responded: “I’m sick of the truth being hijacked by a few loudmouthed morons. Enough already.”
  - Garry Nolan added: “I think you, Chris Mellon, and all of us are at the ‘gloves come off’ stage of negotiation.”
