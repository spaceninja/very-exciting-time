Hot on the heels of the US election, we’re looking ahead to consider whether the upcoming government changes will impact the push for UFO disclosure, or the November 13 UAP hearing in Congress. We also discuss persistent rumors that the James Webb Space Telescope has detected signs of life, and why it’s probably nothing to get excited about. We’ll be back with an episode soon after the hearing!

**Update:** [Congress announced the list of witnesses for the UAP hearing](https://www.liberationtimes.com/home/witnesses-announced-for-landmark-ufo-congressional-hearing) shortly after we recorded. (That’s what we get for trying to record early!) Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet and former head of AATIP Lue Elizondo will be joined by journalist Michael Shellenberger (who broke the Immaculate Constellation story), and Mike Gold, a former NASA official who spent 13 years working Bigelow Aerospace.
