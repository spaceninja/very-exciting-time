This week we’re covering a grab bag of UFO news that happened while we were talking about Lue Elizondo’s book. We’ve got presidential advisor Harald Malmgren announcing that he was briefed on the UAP reverse engineering program, stories of a massive and incredibly fast USO, a bit of information about the new Director of AARO, upcoming UAP hearings in both the House and the Senate, and the latest status of the UAP Disclosure Act. Buckle up, it’s a very exciting time!

## Harald Malmgren Talks UFOs

- Harald Malmgren served as a senior aide to several US Presidents, including JFK, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford, and has served as a strategist and risk advisor for multiple large companies. He’s recently started tweeting about UFOs.
- April: “I was reminded today that I had met and engaged with Jeff Bezos' Grandfather at Los Alamos in 1963 when I was leader of costing the design & build of 1st anti-missile defense system for the JCS, hearing from him his alleged work on reverse engineering of UAP objects!”
- August: “60+ years ago I was provided highest level classifications to lead DOD work on nuclear weapons & anti-missile defense. Informally briefed on "otherworld technologies" by CIA's Richard Bissel (who had been in charge of Skunkworks, Area 51, Los Alamos, etc.) but sworn to secrecy.”
- September: “You asked "is there actual recovered NHI tech?" The answer is yes, in several different hands, both government and private hands. For example, knowing such technology has enabled planning for moon to Mars transportation in days, not years. Don't ask me who has such tech.”

## Pushback to Elizondo’s Recon Theory

- In our recent episodes about former AATIP director Lue Elizondo’s book, we discussed his theory that UAP behave in a way that looks like recon or surveillance activities that we might conduct prior to a military operation, and how that informs his perspective that UAP are a potential threat.
- Richard Geldreich, a software engineer who used to work at SpaceX: “The narrative that UAP's came in the 20th century in order to observe us seems silly. They could have easily used stealth satellites and drones - we would have been none the wiser. Instead UAP's made huge visible shows across the entire world, repeatedly. That's not scouting. Additionally, if you're scouting in order to prep for later military activity, you don't give your adversary any heads up that you're coming. You don't crash your technology near Ground Zero (Trinity), etc. The pure scouting narrative makes little sense.”
- Darren King, aka ExoAcademian: “This is yet another reason why the notion that what we're seeing amounts to a decades-long reconnaissance mission by NHI prior to some kind of invasion is deeply flawed.”

## Elizondo and Gallaudet on USOs

- Speaking of Elizondo, while promoting his book, he appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast:
- Elizondo: “There is a high-resolution video of...I can’t say what platform it was taken from, I can’t say where it was taken from. But, an object that... Do you know how large an offshore oil derrick is? They’re huge, right? They’re almost like a small city, right? They’re like one city block. They’re huge, they’re enormous things. There is a video that shows one of these objects, underwater, that goes by - the speed was calculated between 450 and 550 knots, underwater. And it was bigger than the offshore derrick that it was passing, because you could see in the video the offshore derrick and you can see this thing zip right by it.”
- Gallaudet: “For my ocean science and technology colleagues, if this sounds too fantastic to be true, I can confirm it from other credible sources, and both the USS Maury and USCG Bittersweet had similar encounters in the Pacific and Atlantic at the end of WWII.”

## Senate UAP Hearing in September

- A few weeks ago, Sen Gillibrand confirmed that we’ll see a Senate UAP hearing in September: “Yes, I have it on the schedule.”
- “It’s a priority for me, because I think it's very important that we continue to make things publicly available. Give a progress report on how many UAP we've assessed and analyzed, give examples of what we have identified and give examples of what we haven't identified so that the community can be kept up to speed about what we're actually doing and what this office is doing. We also want to try to continue to build credibility within this office so more of the public can feed in sightings and have a place and a platform to send information and inquiries, because that's eventually what this office is supposed to do.”

## New Director of AARO

- Last month the Pentagon released a statement announcing the new Director of AARO: “Today, Dr. Jon T. Kosloski arrived on detail from the National Security Agency to be appointed as the director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.  Dr. Kosloski brings extensive experience working in multiple scientific fields, including quantum optics and crypto-mathematics, as well as leading mission-oriented research and analysis teams… Under his leadership, AARO will continue to examine the U.S. government historical record relating to UAP, as well as efforts to declassify and release UAP-related records to the greatest extent possible.”
- Liberation Times: “Sources [say] that Dr. Kosloski is showing promising signs of adopting a new approach to the UAP topic, particularly in investigations related to allegations of retrieval and reverse engineering programs involving materials and biologics of non-human intelligence or unknown origin. However, it is still too early to predict the direction Dr. Kosloski will take.”
- Jay Stratton, former director of the UAP Task Force: “The good news is I got a text a few weeks ago from a good friend of mine who was part of the UAP Task Force, Jon Kosloski. And he said, ‘I just got the AARO job.’ [Kosloski is] good. He's trustworthy. And hopefully, he can carry on my legacy.”
- Sean Kirkpatrick, former Director of AARO: “I’ve never heard of [Kosloski] nor ever worked with him.”
- Chris Mellon, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence: “I had the pleasure of spending several hours this week with AARO’s new Director, Dr. Jon Kosloski. Kudos to the officials at DoD and the IC who were involved in selecting Dr. Kosloski for this important position. If my first impression proves accurate, everyone interested in UAP has reason to feel optimistic about a more informative, open-minded, productive, and transparent future for that office.”

## House UAP Hearing in November

- Rep Luna: “Nancy Mace is for sure gonna be chairing the next one.”
- Rep Burchett: “I think Mace really has a grasp of the issue. She asked the tough questions the last time. She has a history with this, and she's known in the UAP/UFO community.”
- Rep Mace confirmed the hearing would be held on Nov 13
- Rep Burchett, asked what he hoped to get out of another UAP hearing: “Exposure. And I think we’ll get some good quality witnesses in. And I think more whistleblowers will come in because we’re serious. And I think that’ll lay the groundwork for the next President to do what’s right with this.”
- Rep Luna, when asked about witnesses: “You guys will be happy.”
- Rep Mace, asked about witnesses: “I wanted to have a military vet. I think it's important to have more than just academics. I need people who’ve maybe seen some sh\*t and can tell us some stuff.”
- Rear Adm Gallaudet: “Yesterday I was invited to testify on UAP disclosure before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Accountability in November. Not sure if Congress will pass the UAP Disclosure Act sponsored by Leader Schumer and Senator Rounds, but I will make a case for it based on the right of the American people to know that we are not alone, and the national security implications of that astonishing reality.”

## UAPDA Fails Again… Or Does It?

- Back in July, we learned that Sen Rounds and Senate Majority Leader Schumer revived the UAP Disclosure Act for the 2025 NDAA, hoping to restore all the parts that were gutted from the 2024 version, including the Presidential review board and the eminent domain clauses.
- D. Dean Johnson reported that the Senate’s version of the NDAA does not include the UAPDA: “This spells the end for the UAPDA in the current Congress. For whatever reasons, the UAPDA did not achieve the degree of consensus necessary to make it into the omnibus bipartisan manager's amendment, which means that the UAPDA will not even be an issue in this year's House-Senate negotiations that will produce the final FY 2025 NDAA later this year.”
- Lester Nare, the founder of the UAP Caucus commented: “The failure of the UAPDA in 2024 is disappointing but not entirely unexpected, given the complexities of the current election cycle, the political dynamics within the 118th Congress, and persistent pushback from institutional gatekeepers. While this setback is significant, it does not mark the end of our efforts towards greater transparency in UAP-related matters.”
- Liberation Times said the UAPDA failed: “due to resistance from Senator Rand Paul.”
- Liberation Times later issued an update: “After initially declining to comment on the record via email, a staffer from Senator Rand Paul’s office… states: ‘Senator Paul cleared that amendment, so any delay was not due to his actions.’”
- The Good Trouble Show: “We found out from a source that Mitch McConnell, not Rand Paul, blocked the amendment's inclusion in the NDAA. The legislation may make it through in other ways. There is still hope.”
- Sen Rounds: “Let me put it this way, [the NDAA’s] not out yet. Negotiations continue.”
