In the latest Congressional UAP hearing, retired Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet, former AATIP director Lue Elizondo, and journalist Michael Shellenberger testified that secret UAP crash retrieval, reverse engineering, and surveillance programs are being illegally concealed from Congress. Lawmakers were warned not to ask certain questions, AARO engaged in a disinformation effort against a witness, and whistleblowers have been harassed, threatened, and publicly discredited, all in an effort to prevent any attempts at public disclosure.

Rep Nancy Mace: “We’ve had two hearings now with multiple witnesses with clearances, esteemed backgrounds, and careers in the military and other federal agencies, that are telling the American people we're being lied to, that Congress is being lied to. This is a bombshell.”

## Witness Statements

- Mike Gold, former NASA administrator: “The topic of UAPs has captivated the public imagination for decades. Instead of vilifying or ridiculing those who dare to study the phenomena, NASA and the scientific community as a whole should seize this singular opportunity to engage the public in a high-profile demonstration of the scientific method. Information should be gathered, results should be studied, hypotheses made, and conclusions tested. …The study of UAPs should be embraced since, whatever is occurring, the chance to garner new knowledge should never be shunned. We must be thorough in collecting information, fearless in making conclusions, and open to following the data no matter how mundane or extraordinary the results may be. …As the saying goes, the truth is out there, we just need to be bold enough and brave enough to face it.”
- Michael Shellenberger, journalist: “One of Congress's most important responsibilities is oversight of the executive branch in general and the military and intelligence community in particular. Unfortunately, there is a growing body of evidence that the US government is not being transparent about what it knows about Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and that elements within the Military and the Intelligence Community are in violation of their constitutional duty to notify Congress of their operations.”
- Tim Gallaudet, retired Navy Rear Admiral: “I concluded that the UAP information must have been classified within a Special Access Program managed by an intelligence agency — a compartmented program that even senior officials, including myself, were not read into. Last year’s UAP hearing before this oversight committee confirmed that UAP-related information is not only being withheld from senior officials and members of Congress, but elements of the government are engaging in a disinformation campaign to include personal attacks designed to discredit UAP whistleblowers.”
- Lue Elizondo, former director of AATIP: “Let me be clear: UAP are real. Advanced technologies not made by our Government – or any other government – are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe. Furthermore, the U.S. is in possession of UAP technologies, as are some of our adversaries. I believe we are in the midst of a multi-decade, secretive arms race—one funded by misallocated taxpayer dollars and hidden from our elected representatives and oversight bodies.”

## Immaculate Constellation

- Rep Nancy Mace: “Representative Luna just told me that if I say ‘Immaculate Constellation,’ I’ll be on some list. Maybe a FISA warrant. So, uh, come at me, bro.”
- Rep. Mace: “There is a document that will be entered into the congressional record today, the original document from the Pentagon about IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION that Michael Shellenberger delivered to Congress today. So thank you, Mr. Shellenberger, for this information… twelve pages about this unacknowledged special access program that your government says does not exist.”
  - The opening paragraph of the report says it’s the result of a “multi-year internal investigation… undertaken in response to urgent and credible threats to the public good and safety of the US and provided to Congress through UAP whistleblower mechanisms… The data consulted during this investigation, and summarized in this report, original from non-public data held within the Executive branch. The author obtained access …while pursuing their lawful duties as an employee of the Department of Defense. This public version of the author’s report was reviewed and approved for public release by the Department of State, Bureau of Global Public Affairs.”
- Rep Mace: “Okay. What's the key takeaway… about the Immaculate Constellation document you provided us today.”
  - Shellenberger: “I think that what the American people need to know is that the US military and intelligence community are sitting on a huge amount of visual and other information—still photos, video photos, other sensor information—and they have for a very long time. And it's not those fuzzy photos and videos. There’s very clear images, high resolution.”
- Rep Mace: "Do you have more than one credible source?”
  - Shellenberger: “I do.”
  - Mace: “Why do you believe your sources to be credible? How do you judge the veracity of the documentation you've been provided about this program?”
  - Shellenberger: “I checked the sources and they are who they say they are. They are current or former government officials. …I checked the report and I did not find it based on existing cases. …That answered for me that it was not obviously circular reporting, which is one of the big concerns in this space. I also had the name of the program confirmed by more than one additional source.”
- Report: “Elements of the US Executive Branch have conspired to prevent the US Legislative Branch from exercising its lawful powers of governance with respect to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, Technologies of Unknown Origin, and Non-Human Intelligence issues. …The US Executive Branch has been managing UAP/NHI issues without Congressional knowledge, oversight, or authorization for some time, quite possibly decades. This criminal conspiracy keeps the elected government of the United States and its citizens ignorant to profound discoveries and dire threats originating from the existence of UAP, NHI, and their technologies.”
- Report: “IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION pays particular attention to anomalous aerospace platforms that have been developed through the study or acquisition of technologies of unknown origin by foreign nations or unknown entities. …IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION shows that the USG is not only aware of UAPs and TUO, but also foreign state efforts to replicate UAP and TUO capabilities.”
- Report: “UAP and Alien Reproduction Vehicle signatures and preferred operating areas are known to the program, enabling a degree of strategic awareness and warning. …The data within IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION reveals the capability of the US Armed Services and Military Intelligence Community to detect, track, identify, and engage anomalous transmedium platforms.”
- Report: “IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION also demonstrates the extant capability to detect, quarantine, and transfer UAP and RV collection incidents before they are observed and circulated within the Military Intelligence Enterprise, partially explaining why many otherwise cleared members of the military and IC are unaware of UAP activities.”
- Report: “Finally, the existence of IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION provides verifiable evidence of the witting participation by elements of the US Armed Services, Defense Civil Service, and the Intelligence Community in a global surveillance and reconnaissance mission tasked with monitoring UAPs and ARVs.”

## Pushback on the hearing and witnesses

- Rep. Mace: “UAPs remain a controversial topic. I'm not going to name names, but there are certain individuals who didn't want this hearing to happen because they feared what might be disclosed. But we stood firm, no amount of outside pressure would ever keep me from pursuing this subject to ground come hell or high water.”
- Rep. Jared Moskowitz: “When the American people and members of Congress ask, ‘Are reports of UAPs credible?’ We're met with stonewalling, we're met with responses of, ‘I can't tell you.’ And in fact we're met with people not wanting us to have hearings, we're met with people not wanting us to ask you questions. In fact, many of us were told not to ask some of you certain questions on certain topics.”
- Gallaudet: “I say this as a first-hand witness to such disinformation. During a meeting with the then acting AARO director and his senior staff earlier this year, I was the object of an hours-long influence operation which attempted to convince me of the validity of the severely flawed historical records report, question well known UAP reports such as the U.S.S. Nimitz ‘tic tac’ encounter, and disparage several former government authorities who have published and spoken publicly about their knowledge of U.S. government UAP programs. If AARO is attempting to repeat the illegal and unethical DoD disinformation efforts involving UAP in the past, Congress should be gravely concerned.”
- Elizondo: “Excessive secrecy has led to grave misdeeds against loyal civil servants, military personnel, and the public – all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos. A small cadre within our own Government involved in the UAP topic has created a culture of suppression and intimidation that I have personally been victim to, along with many of my former colleagues. This includes unwarranted criminal investigations, harassment, and efforts to destroy one’s credibility. …Many of my former colleagues and I have provided classified testimony to both the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community Inspector General, and many of us have subsequently been targeted by this cabal with threats to our careers, our security clearances, and even our lives. This is not hyperbole, but a genuine fact and this is wrong.”
- Rep Andy Ogles: “I'll say this, it is clear from my experience, and from what I've seen, there's something out there. The question is, is it ours, is it some one else's, or is it otherworldly? And Madam Chairman, I would posit that as the legislative body, as the regulatory body, we must know. And anyone who prevents us from gaining access to that information, I would consider that criminality.”

## Mellon’s Satellite Imagery

- Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Chris Mellon: “Several years ago, I reviewed a remarkable intelligence report featuring clear satellite imagery of a fast- moving UAP. This imagery, echoing DNI John Ratcliffe's 2021 remarks on UAP captured by satellite, exemplifies the information Congress should have ready access to. After my review, I informed Senate Armed Services and Intelligence staff. However, when they requested the report from AARO (then led by Dr. Kirkpatrick), AARO replied that it held no record of any UAP satellite imagery. This incident reflects a broader, systemic issue: Crucial UAP data remains inaccessible to Congress and, apparently, to AARO itself. Last week, after years of searching, I finally located and relayed to Congress the whereabouts of this satellite report, hopefully enabling Congress to submit a successful request.”

## Lockheed UFO Divestment Story

- Rep. Eric Burlison: “Does any branch of the United States government or defense contractors possess technology?”
- Elizondo: “My predecessor program, AAWSAP, was trying to collect material of unknown origin.”
- Burlison: “Was it successfully collected?”
- Elizondo: “It was not. What happened is that there was an aerospace contract company that requested to divest itself of the material that was collected in 1950s. Unfortunately, that didn't actually occur.”
- Burlison: “So there was a journalist, Christopher Sharp, who said that there was a transfer between Lockheed Martin, Bigelow Aerospace and the CIA allegedly blocked this. Can you describe that?”
- Elizondo: “What I can say is that it was blocked. Why it was blocked I can only surmise. I was part of some conversations later on with some of those contract personnel where they had told all of us that is accurate.”
- Burlison: “It was previously testified that there's biologics that were collected. Are you aware of any of that?”
- Elizondo: “I can tell you anecdotally that it was discussed quite a bit when I was at the Pentagon. The problem is the supposed collection of these biological samples occurred before my time, in fact, before I was even born.”
- Burlison: “And was this part of the Lockheed Martin discussion?”
- Elizondo: “Separate yet related.”

## “Non-Verbal” Contact

- Rep. Burlison: “Has anyone made contact? …Has there been, to your knowledge, any communication with a non-human life form?”
- Elizondo: “So the term communication is a bit of a trick word because there's verbal communication, like we're having now. The problem is you also have non-verbal communication. And so I would say definitively yes, but from a non-verbal, meaning when a Russian reconnaissance aircraft comes into US airspace, we scramble two F-22s, and we are certainly communicating intent and capability. I think the same goes with this. We have these things that are being observed over controlled US airspace, and they're not really doing a good job hiding themselves. They're making it pretty obvious they have the ability to even interfere with our nuclear equities and our nuclear readiness.”

## Elizondo Can’t Talk About Crash Retrieval

- Rep. Mace: “Are you read into secret UAP crash retrieval programs?”
- Elizondo: “I signed documentation three years ago that restricts my ability to discuss specifically crash retrievals.”
- Mace: “Has the government conducted secret UAP crash retrieval programs, yes or no?”
- Elizondo: “Yes.”
- Mace: “Were they designed to identify and reverse engineer alien craft, yes or no?”
- Elizondo: “Yes.”
- Rep. Moskowitz: “You specifically said the document said you can't talk about crash retrieval. Well, you can't talk about fight club if there's no fight club.”

## Government Compensation for UAP Injuries

- Rep Mace: “In your book, you mentioned government employees who've been injured by UAPs placed on leave and receiving government compensation for their injuries. Is that correct?”
- Elizondo: “That is correct.”
- Mace: “How can the government deny we have recovered craft if they're paying people because they've been injured by recovered craft?”
- Elizondo: “Ma'am, that's a great question. That's why I think we're here again, because I've seen the documentation by the US government for several of these individuals who have sustained injuries as a result of a UAP incident.”
- NewsNation: “The Veterans Administration has granted full medical disability benefits to Airman John Burroughs for injuries to his heart and eyes that he claims to have suffered during the famous 1980 UAP incident in England’s Rendlesham Forest, a series of reported sightings of unexplained lights just outside Royal Air Force Woodbridge, which was used at the time by the United States Air Force.”

## Drama Llamas

- Rep Tim Burchett: “I always say dadgummit after these miserable hearings, they’re bogus. Look, I could’ve answered every one of those dadgum questions, and you know it and I know it. I know more about this than the average bear, I guess. Maybe that’s a scary thought, but this thing’s a coverup.”
  - Journalist: “I’m a little surprised that you call these hearings worthless, you’ve been one of the ones spearheading this and pushing this forward!”
  - Burchett: “I guess if you wanna hear more government officials that have some guts to tell us that these things do exist, I mean, I dunno how much more proof we need of that. What we need is someone in the executive office to come forth with this stuff, and I think Trump is the guy.”
- Former director of AARO Sean Kirkpatrick: “Mr. Gallaudet is clearly still bitter that I didn’t hire him into AARO when he came looking for a job. His predisposed tendencies for conspiracies without evidence made him unsuitable for a job that required objectivity and evidence-based reason. I verified my decision with some of his previous bosses and peers.”
