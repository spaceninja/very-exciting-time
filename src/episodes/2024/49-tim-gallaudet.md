Today we’re talking about the latest high-profile figure to call for public disclosure of contact with a non-human intelligence, retired US Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet. After serving as administrator of NOAA, he’s now on the boards of the SOL Foundation and Americans for Safe Aerospace, and is publicly advocating for further investigation into USO and increased undersea exploration.

## Background

- Tim Gallaudet is a retired US Navy Rear Admiral who has been banging the drum about USOs for the last two years.
- “I’m a scuba diver, and a naturalist. I worked as an oceanographer in the Navy for 32 years, then went into a government agency, and now I’m a private consultant.”
  - He has a masters in oceanography and PhD in marine acoustics from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego.
  - He served as the superintendent of the US Naval Observatory, then as Head Oceanographer of the Navy, and then as Commander of the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command.
  - Then he was the acting administrator of NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
  - Now he’s a research affiliate for Harvard’s Galileo Project, and on the boards of both the SOL Foundation and Americans for Safe Aerospace.
- “I led NOAA, which is the nation’s climate, weather, and ocean agency and we had 20,000 people, a 7 billion annual budget, 18 environmental satellites, 16 ships, nine aircraft, some of which fly through hurricanes, and a whole armada of boats and scuba divers characterizing and predicting and managing our ocean resources.”
- Explaining why he was open to the idea of NHI: “I had a job where I was the superintendent of the US Naval Observatory, and I had a team of astrophysicists that monitored the stars and made star catalogs. I learned a lot about astrophysics in that job, and I came to appreciate how large the universe is. You just cannot conclude, when you know that there’s 200-300 billion stars in our galaxy, and there’s hundreds of billions of galaxies, to think that we’re alone is incredibly arrogant.”

## Shocking Statements

- Speaking to Ross Coulthart on NewsNation: “I think it's about time that we disclose that we are in contact with non-human intelligence. That’s what needs to be put out there to the public.”
- Big Thing podcast: “We’re experiencing a non-human higher intelligence. They possess craft that can do things we can’t explain, with technology we can’t explain, and with laws of physics that are not what we know them to be.”
  - “I am completely convinced because I know the people who were in the government legacy programs that oversaw both the crash retrieval and analysis of UAP data. I’m very confident in these people, former intelligence, former DoD, and we are working as a team behind the scenes to advance disclosure.”
- Liberation Times: “I do know from the people I trust, who have had access to some of these programs, that there are different types of non-human intelligence visiting us… We still don't understand their intentions, which is worthy of serious research and discussion, instead of putting our heads in the sand.”

## Secret US Navy Email

- SOL Foundation talk: “When I was a one-star Admiral working for US Fleet forces command in Norfolk, a four-star Admiral command in charge of all the ships in the Navy that are training Stateside, they were running an exercise in 2014 to 2015 where Ryan Graves was operating. he was flying his F-18 Hornet Super Hornet off the USS Roosevelt. I was the chief meteorologist of the Navy and so all my meteorologists were on Navy ships like the USS Roosevelt forecasting weather, a very critical safety of flight mission. During that time, I received an email on the Navy secret network from my boss, a two-star admiral, the operations officer at Fleet forces command. All the addressees were one and two star Admirals like me. I was in a support command, others were operational, like strike group commanders, the Roosevelt and others. The topic of the email was ‘urgent safety of flight issue’ and the content of the email was fairly brief it just said ‘If any of you know what these are, tell me ASAP. We're having numerous near midair collisions and we're going to have to shut the exercise down if they don't stop. Attached was the GOFAST video that everyone's seen now.”
  - “F-18 pilots captured video of this UAP scorching over the water. There's no flight control surfaces or propulsion means that are visible. It's just a little round sphere. And then the pilots are all going crazy. And I knew right then and there that was not ours. We don't have technology like that. I was read into a lot of Special Access Programs, to the best of my knowledge, and we would never do that in a training range, especially aircraft carrier workups are so compressed, they have to do all these things. The pilots got to get certified. They got to land so many times on the carrier, they got to do all these things and certify to go deploy. So throwing out advanced technology in a training range during a pre deployment workup just doesn't happen. I mean, people will get fired. And, of course, we have testing ranges to do that. So I knew that wasn’t ours. I also had been reading all the threats, our adversaries capabilities. I knew nobody else had that. And so I knew right there that was something not ours, not human, off world, whatever.”
  - “The next day, my email was wiped from my computer, and everybody else who received it… I go to monthly meetings at my boss's headquarters in Norfolk, and we always talk about staying up with the training cycle, and safety issues always came up. And this was a big safety issue. The OPS officer said so and so, and my job as the chief meteorologist in the Navy, another one of my hats, was safety of flight. And so we get into the next monthly meeting, and no one brings this stuff up. No one's talking about it, about a safety issue, almost canceling this major training event. This left Ryan and his fellow pilots having to develop their own mitigation measures himself. This whole over classification issue… if you want to call it that, was forcing a failure in leadership that I couldn't, or my fellow Admirals, could not look out for Ryan and his fellow pilots. That is a problem, and that's something we have to correct. That's why I'm speaking out about this, and I seriously don't know why other Admirals who are retired aren't either.”

## Evidence for USOs

- SOL Foundation talk: “Where I want to go with scientific UAP research is somewhere that suits me, the undersea piece. We've observed these objects going transmedium and, in fact, just in the year and a half or so that I've become active and have started interviewing people, I have met dozens of people: commercial, military, coast guard, mariners and submariners, who have had observations. …This is happening, and I'm working to get a better understanding of it and get data.”
- From his SOL Foundation whitepaper, “Beneath the Surface”: “Research and attention regarding Unidentified Aerial Phenomena are almost entirely focused on their aerial occurrences. Yet instances of UAP at sea, whether under the surface or traveling ‘transmedium’—between the atmosphere and the ocean—are also known to occur. Perhaps the most widely publicized example was the ‘Tic Tac’ UAP, described by Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet pilots as hovering above roiling ocean whitewater during a training exercise in 2004. The whitewater may have indicated a larger UAP below or that the observed UAP had emerged from the sea, suggesting an unidentified submersible object (USO).”
- “More recently, [a transmedium UAP was observed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8A6znZCUxE) by US Navy personnel onboard the USS Omaha west of San Diego in 2019.”
- “The most dramatic example of an apparent transmedium UAP is the [video from Aguadilla, Puerto Rico](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJpyJ_G9WVA), captured by the thermal imaging system on a US Customs and Border Protection DHC-8 aircraft in 2013. Detailed analysis of the data by the Scientific Coalition of UAP Studies (SCU) reveals several potentially unexplainable aspects of this object. It was initially detected moving at a low level over a runway at Rafael Hernández Airport, where its presence was so prominent that it delayed the departure of a commercial flight. Over three minutes, the object appears to fly at speeds between 40 and 120 miles per hour, enter and exit the Atlantic Ocean without any significant deceleration, reach a maximum underwater velocity of 95 miles per hour, and at one point split into two parts before entering the water again. …No known aircraft, naval vessel, projectile, or human-made technology possess these characteristics or capabilities.”
- “Chris Styles interviewed several Royal Canadian Navy divers who participated in US–Canadian joint mine-sweeping exercise off Shelburne Harbour, Nova Scotia, in 1960, and claimed to have observed two disc-shaped craft on the seabed. Furthermore, the divers claimed they not only saw the occupants of the two craft trying to repair one of them but also recorded underwater footage of this extravehicular activity. It is only after the recent US military UAP whistleblower testimony that this story seems credible.”
- “So a guy came to me and said, hey, I was on a sub in the eighties, I could talk to you about what I saw. He was a nuclear submarine officer in the North Atlantic. It was very high sea state because of a storm, 40 foot waves, so they were operating below that, but even there they were kind of rocking. Subs can feel that wave action. And because it was so rough, it created a lot of ambient noise. And in those conditions, it is really hard to passively detect another submarine. So they felt pretty secure. They weren't going to be detected by a Russian sub, and they probably weren't going to hear one either.”
  - “So he's on the watch, and all of a sudden they get a passive hit, a contact that's moving off the starboard… Then it paused and started closing on them rapidly. And they call that constant bearing decreasing range.”
  - “You don't want that when you're a sub driver. You know, that's going to be a collision. It had every feature that a Russian torpedo would have in terms of the constant bearing decreasing range at a very rapid rate. And they were so convinced, he called the captain to the bridge. They set general quarters and they dived and it kept on coming, and it kept on coming, and they were hoping to get below some acoustic lens or whatever that wouldn't be able to find them and lose track. And it just kept coming. And so they went as deep as just above crush depth.”
  - “Crush depth is the depth that a submarine will implode. And that's a dangerous place to be on an older sub like this. But they were convinced this was a russian sub coming at them and then at some range, close, it paused and then slowly took station on their stern, behind them, and trailed them for a while.”
  - “So they're getting this passive acoustic hit of something doing this, and then after a few minutes, it just rapidly departed the scene. There was no explanation. The Russians didn't have technology like that in the 80s. We didn't have technology like that. And again, to this day, he doesn't know. But when you go around the Navy and talk to other sonar techs, they say they do see these quite often.”
  - “The data is collected and archived at Johns Hopkins University, and I'm in the process of reinstating my clearance, and I want to look into that.”
  - AARO said they would look into the acoustic datasets, but they haven’t heard anything from AARO since.

## Disclosure

- At SOL conference: "The Hill's doing it right. I just was approached by Rep Luna, she's interested in having another field hearing, this time on USOs, undersea UAP. And that's good. So there's action being taken.”
- "But what about the Executive branch? This is where things aren't going well. You have this big disconnect between the story [Grusch] told and, of course, the AARO office under Dr. Kirkpatrick. Why is that? And it's not complicated. Sean can’t do and say things without clearance from the SecDef, and above him, the National Security Council of the White House, and likely ODNI… This White House does not want to disclose. That's their policy and Sean is merely following that suit."
- Liberation Times: “The DoD moves in the direction the National Security Council says to, and at the direction of the President. A lot of people will blame AARO for not being fully open and transparent. But their direction comes right from the National Security Council - so it’s coming from the White House. The latest AARO report showed that they want to keep knowledge of UAP unacknowledged, which makes sense. This President right now is not looking good in the polls, and I wouldn't think that he'd want to disclose to the public all of a sudden in this election year that, ‘hey, we don't know what's in our airspace or water space and we can't control it - have a good day America.’”
  - “Liberation Times understands from multiple sources that individuals within the White House were supportive of the UAPDA and coordinated with Senator Chuck Schumer.”
- “Let’s get a policy of disclosure. I realize some technology might have to remain classified, but the fact that we’re being visited by non-human intelligence? The public should know this, and we should develop policy regarding our response to that.”
