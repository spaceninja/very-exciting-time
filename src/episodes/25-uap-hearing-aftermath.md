In this week’s exciting episode, we cover the aftermath of last week’s explosive UAP hearing, including Chris Mellon’s claims that AARO is withholding satellite imagery of UAP from Congress, the fallout and possible legal consequences of Dr. Kirkpatrick’s weird LinkedIn post, continued evasion from the Pentagon, and the major aerospace companies going into press lockdown following whistleblower allegations that they’re involved in the reverse engineering program.

## Mellon Claims Satellite Images Not Shared with Congress

- Chris Mellon, the former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence posted on Twitter: “The fact that AARO has not shared satellite imagery of UAP with Congress is itself evidence of an effort to keep Congress in the dark. …I recall the oversight committees asking about long-rumored UAP satellite data back in 2017 when I first brought the committees unclassified military UAP videos and worked with Lue Elizondo to make introductions to Navy aviators. The fact this data has still not been shared with the oversight committees is simply outrageous. AARO and the Administration cannot claim to be acting in good faith on the UAP issue while blatantly ignoring these lawful requests.”
- When interviewed by James Fox, Chris Mellon said: "I've seen some VERY compelling evidence. Evidence that I very much wish was in the public domain. When I'm talking to these scientists at the Galileo project for example, and the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies... I so wish that they were privy to this information. That the public was privy to this information. …This is not something in our inventory."

## Kirkpatrick’s Statement

- On Friday the 28th, two days after the hearing, Dr Kirkpatrick, the head of AARO, posted a statement on LinkedIn, calling the testimony “insulting” and saying he was “deeply disappointed at the denigration of AARO’s dedicated men and women.” Though most of his ire was reserved for Grusch, some was aimed at Congress, questioning their commitment to transparency and accusing them of withholding evidence from AARO.
- Rep Luna: “We just had a witness (Grusch) testify to Congress he was in fear for his life and his former boss (Kirkpatrick) decides to post a letter attempting to discredit him? Seems odd.”
- Pentagon spokeswoman Susan Gough: “The department is aware of Dr Kirkpatrick’s post, which are his personal opinions expressed in his capacity as a private citizen and we won’t comment directly on the contents of the post.”
- Nick Pope, Former head of UK’s UFO investigation: “When I worked at the MoD, all communication with the media had to be via public affairs. Firing off a personal missive like this was unheard of.”
- Lt. Tim McMillan, co-founder of the Debrief: “I legitimately don’t think I’ve ever seen a senior civil-servant publicly admonish Congress, and Congressional witnesses, including one with an active whistleblower investigation. I have pending interviews with some government attorneys to explore if Kirkpatrick violated the Hatch Act by releasing his statement.”
- Jeremy Corbell: “I'm not a lawyer, I'm just a bearded guy who likes to poke the bear… but I've heard from those smarter than me that violations of the Hatch Act can be read to include ‘Using official authority to discourage political activity of persons before the employing agency.’ Understand this; interfering with Congress and whistleblowers is illegal. Like, jail time illegal.”
- Rogue UAPTF: “Dr. Kirkpatrick’s statement was highly unethical, inaccurate, and perhaps most importantly, likely a violation of federal law as it appears to have not been cleared for public release. His clock is ticking.”
- Liberation Times: “There is no indication from the DoD that Kirkpatrick is no longer the Director of the AARO, despite publishing the letter, which was likely done without clearance. Liberation Times does however understand that Kirkpatrick's position as AARO Director may be untenable.”

## Misleading Pentagon Statements

- Susan Gough, responding to Grusch’s testimony that people had been harmed to keep the program secret: “The Department has no information that any individual has been harmed or killed as a result of providing information to AARO.  Any unsubstantiated claims that individuals have been harmed or killed in the process of providing information to AARO will serve to discourage individuals with relevant information from coming forward to aid in AARO’s efforts.”
- She also said “AARO welcomes the opportunity to speak with any former or current government employee or contractor who believes they have information relevant to the congressionally-mandated historical review, and AARO has established a safe and secure process for individuals to come forward with information to aid in this effort.”
- Ross Coulthart: “I’ve just had a conversation this morning with somebody who approached me on behalf of a potential witness from within the legacy program, somebody who purports to have direct knowledge of the very same program that David Grusch is talking about, and they’re asking my advice about how to approach. And frankly, one of the issues at the moment is the Pentagon’s UFO/UAP investigation office, AARO, is sending out a shocking signal. It doesn’t have a phone number. It doesn’t have an email address. It doesn’t even have a website. …If this truly is an agency inside the Pentagon that’s seriously interested in proactively investigating and hearing from witnesses, it’s not sending that message out. So I’m in the dilemma at the moment, of where do I send these poor people? And I’m encouraging them to come forward to either the ICIG or the DODIG, or frankly, just come forward to the Senate intelligence committee with the evidence they have, because I have to say, not a lot of people have a lot of faith in the current body that the Pentagon has entrusted and that Congress has mandated to do these kind of investigations.”

## Lockheed’s Response on UAPs

- Two weeks before the hearing, Condorman, an aerospace engineer on Twitter said “There’s a sudden hard industry crackdown on all things UAP. All engineering teams at my company (and a second I know of) have been told no press contact, including anonymous/unnamed. All exotic materials or craft questions are to be referred to AARO.”
- When asked about the hearing, Rep. AOC said: “I do think there’s something going on. In the past, we’ve found defense contractors hiding things. We have truly documented instances of defense contractors being shady. That’s one of the themes that I saw sticking out at the hearing, was the presence of defense contractors. One of the witnesses called out Boeing as a contractor, another called out abuse of the IRAD program and misuse of the appropriations process, which is basically Congress says we spent this money on this thing for this purpose, and sometimes people shift that money around in a way that’s not authorized. That to me is actionable. That to me is a thread that can be pulled.”
- After the hearing, NewsNation reached out to the biggest defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin and others, to ask for a response to Grusch’s claims they’re involved in a UAP reverse engineering program.
  - Lockheed: “Questions about UAPs are best addressed by the US Government.”
  - Ross Coulthart: “Why on earth should the DOD have to answer for Lockheed on whether a SEC-listed aerospace contractor is secretly holding retrieved non-human technology? What should Lockheed shareholders think?”
  - Ross Coulthart: “If Lockheed-Martin is holding an alien spacecraft, it is … probably the most valuable object on the planet - it's priceless. Why haven't shareholders been informed about that if that's the case? … This could be their undoing”
  - Former government attorney: “The key is make it personal for these aerospace companies and their management. They will sing like canaries if their c-suite is picked up in an FBI dragnet and the first guy who talks walks with immunity and everybody else dies in prison for treason. They did this to get rich and if you take that away, they'll abandon the corporate strategy and beg for the chance to not spend the rest of their life in jail”
  - Condorman: “The public corporations (Lockheed, Northrop, Boeing, RTX (Raytheon), etc. are all under SEC rules, including clawback provisions. Their executives’ past bonuses and stock can be ‘clawed back’ if they’ve misstated financial reports or withheld financial significant information.”
