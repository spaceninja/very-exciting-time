This week we’re covering two topics. Firstly, UAP whistleblower David Grusch’s past struggles with PTSD and suicide are published, sparking claims that the intelligence community is attempting to discredit Grusch and intimidate other witnesses. Then, we get weird, discussing a Reddit post where a molecular biologist claims to have worked in a program studying the genetics of alien bodies for a defense contractor. The details are fascinating, and there’s some indications that the scientist may be legit. Chuck and I are especially fascinated by his claims about the alien’s religion, belief in a “soul field.”

## Grusch’s PTSD Struggles Leaked

- On Tuesday, UAP Whistleblower David Grusch released a statement via Ross Coulthart, one of the journalists he’s been working with:
  - “The mental health struggles of U.S. military and Intelligence Community personnel is a broad issue that is very close to my heart, and I believe it should be discussed in an open environment due to the stigmas associated with the subject. It has come to my attention that The Intercept intends to publish an article about two incidents in 2014 and 2018 that highlights previous personal struggles I had with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Grief and Depression.”
  - “Like many veterans, I struggled after returning home from Afghanistan. Furthermore, I was personally affected again years later when a close friend of mine, an intelligence officer who was serving in Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) at the time, took his own life shortly after we last spoke. I am proud to be transparent on this matter and am glad I got the help I needed to continue my intelligence career and maintain my TS//SCI clearance with multiple agencies.”
- Coulthart appeared on NewsNation that night and accused the intelligence community of leaking the info, because it could only have come from the intelligence community or the Sheriff's office, and the Sheriff confirmed to Coulthart it didn’t come from him.
- UFO Twitter EXPLODED with speculation about attacks on Grusch, and dirty dealing by intelligence agencies, with some blaming the CIA directly, and others accusing Grusch and Coulthart of manufacturing a conspiracy theory.
- The article was published on Wednesday and detailed two incidents where Grusch had the cops called on him after threatening suicide. The article made it clear that the records were not confidential, medical, or leaked, but came from a routine FOIA request to the Sheriff's office.
- Later on Wednesday, the author of the article, Ken Klippenstein, revealed that he was tipped off by “intel people” to look for information on Grusch's background in police reports.
  - “…I was getting bits and pieces from different people about stuff that they were saying. So you know how the intel people, they’re vague, they’ll be like look into his background, and they were kind of hinting… Multiple people told me to just look at any run ins with law enforcement that they had, that he had had in the past.”
- Ross Coulthart: “It’s admitted by the journalist himself now that he was told where to look by sources inside IC & DOD who were trying to smear David Grusch. Their tip could only have come from Grusch’s highly classified security files.”
- Tim Burchett: “That’s just disgusting. Someone needs to lose their job.”
- George Knapp: “The attempted slime job on Dave Grusch is too late to stop his testimony, but is a serious warning to anyone else who might step forward. It tells potential witnesses that every aspect of their lives will be fair game.”
- Lue Elizondo: “The silent suffering of our brave men and women in uniform is a cost our veterans pay to keep our society free. A veteran's PTSD should NEVER be used against them. Shame on any ‘journalist’ who writes BS articles attacking a veteran for the health consequences of their service to our nation.”

## EBO Scientist: Let’s Get Weird!

- About a month ago, a post blew up on reddit: “From the late 2000s to the mid-2010s, I worked as a molecular biologist for a national security contractor in a program to study Exo-Biospheric-Organisms (EBO)”
- “I will be purposely vague or even contradictory about any information that could identify me (date, education, role etc.). I'll even introduce red herrings in this respect. I want to make it clear that any information related to the subject of the research will not be treated in this way.”

### The Program

- “The aim of the program was to elucidate the genome and proteome basis of these organisms. …New high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies of the late 90s unblocked stagnant research… we've discovered that the EBO genome is a chimera of genomes from our biosphere and from an unknown one. They are artificial, ephemeral and disposable organisms created for a purpose that still partially eludes us.”
- **Onboarding:** “The first weeks were by far the most memorable, although I spent most of that time in a depressing archive room. It consists almost exclusively of reading about the subject of study and to get us up to speed. There's no secret Wikipedia or even a reference book to guide us. There are only dry reports, memos, presentations, procedures and SOPs. These documents are almost exclusively about the biology of EBOs, but there are also a few that deal with other subjects such as their food, religion or culture. There were no documents on their technology.”
- **The Team:** “A team of around twenty scientists, four senior scientists and a director was involved. The scientists, like myself, had as their main responsibility to carry out the technical work. As each scientist had… a Ph.D., we were all somewhat overqualified for what is ultimately a technician's job. …Other than the scientific staff, there were security guards working for one subcontractor or another. There were no support staff such as janitors or maintenance workers. Scientists were responsible for this kind of work. In addition, logistical constraints ensure that every scientist is capable of carrying out any technical activity.”
- **The Lab:** “The laboratory itself, Battelle National Biodefense Institute, is located in Fort Detrick, Maryland, in a building used for legitimate biomedical research. The clandestine operations are carried out in a restricted part of the basement, out of sight from regular workers. Contrary to what one might imagine, the biosafety level is not maximal for this type of research. Indeed, the lab containing EBO samples or derived cell cultures is BSL3, while the lab where assays are conducted are only BSL2. The BSL3 area of the facility includes a freezer room and a cell culture lab and is only accessible through an antechamber from the BSL2 section.
- **Alien Bodies:** “EBO carcasses are preserved in horizontal freezers at a temperature of -80°C nominal. To maximize the preservation of these carcasses, they are preserved in vacuum bags and the air in the room is controlled to minimize humidity. There are only four bodies and none of them are complete. It's obvious that these creatures have died as a result of major trauma. I've never witnessed a motorcycle accident fatality, but it probably looks similar to this. It is acknowledged that there are more EBOs carcasses at other locations.”

### Genetics

- I’m skipping over a LOT of detail here that I don’t understand.
- **Common Ancestry:** “Their genetics are like ours, based on DNA. This fact was very puzzling for me when I first learned about it. We imagine that beings from an alternate biosphere would have genetics based on a completely foreign biochemical system and surprisingly, this is not the case. Several conclusions can be drawn from this surprising revelation. The one that immediately comes to mind is that our biosphere and theirs share a common ancestry.”
- **Genetic Engineering:** “What's particularly striking about the EBO genome is the uniformity of these intergenic regions. We see the same sequences repeated everywhere… The result is a minimalist, highly condensed genome. In fact, it's much smaller than ours. …The uniformity of these sequences is a major indication of the artificiality of these beings. There is no complex organism on earth that has such elegance in its sequences. There is no evolutionary pressure that can lead to this kind of characteristic other than genetic engineering.”

### Anatomy

- “They are morphologically very similar to the grey aliens that are part of modern folklore. Their height is about 150cm, they have two arms, two legs and a head. Still, there are some notable differences.”
- **Head:** “The head contains two large, oversized eyes, two nostrils without protuberance, a narrow mouth without lips and two ear canals without auricles. There are no teeth or tongue in the oral cavity. There are no vocal cords in this region. Vocalization is produced by vibration of a membrane in the lungs.”
- **Skin:** The grey skin that is often described in folklore is in fact a biosynthetic film which, likely, serves to protect the EBO from a hostile environment. …Under the grey film, the epidermis is rather white, and the texture is very regular and without any hair. We do not see any defect other than the folds near the joints. It's described as greasy in one report, but that's not something I've observed. The same report states that a strong, lingering smell of burnt hair and ammonia is present when the film is removed. There are a lot of pores on the skin, crossing from the epidermis to a gland in the hypodermis. These glands and pores are the terminal part of the excretory-sudoriferous system, which could explain the previously mentioned smell.”
- **Waste System:** “There are no genitals or anus. There is no large orifice, like an anus or urethra, to get rid of biological waste. Waste [in the form of] ammonia is carried to thousands of excretory pores. The rationale behind this unusual excretory system is directly related to this excreted ammonia, which enables thermoregulation by evaporating on the skin's surface.”
- **Liquid Diet:** “Given the absence of teeth, the narrowness and rigidity of the esophagus, the absence of a true stomach and the absence of defecation, it is strongly believed that EBOs can only consume food in liquid form. It is assumed that, given the high metabolic needs of their brains, this food would have a high carbohydrate concentration. In order to meet other metabolic needs, there must also be a high protein content in the food consumed. These two statements are supported by the type of enzyme secreted by the digestive organ. It is therefore speculated that the food consumed is a sort of broth rich in sugar and protein.”
- **Eyes:** Like the skin, the eyes are covered with a semi-transparent biosynthetic film that offers the same environmental protection, while providing protection against certain wavelengths and light intensity. When the film is removed, a more traditional eye is revealed. It's about three times larger than a human eye and there are no eyelids. The size of their eyes suggests they have excellent night vision. It seems paradoxical to cover them with a semi-opaque film. Perhaps they only need to wear it in a bright environment. On the retina, there are at least 6 types of cone cells. The result is a broader visible spectrum.

### Religion: Let’s Get Weirder!

- “EBOs believe that the soul is not an extension of the individual, but rather a fundamental characteristic of nature that expresses itself as a field, not unlike gravity. In the presence of life, this field acquires complexity… With time, and with the right conditions, life in turn becomes more complex until the appearance of sentient life. After reaching this threshold, the field begins to express itself through these sentient beings, forming what we call the soul. Through their life experiences, sentient beings will in turn influence the field in a sort of positive feedback loop. This in turn further accelerates the complexity of the field. Eventually, when the field reaches a "critical mass", there will be a sort of apotheosis. It's not clear what this means in practical terms, but this quest for apotheosis seems to be the EBOs main motivation.”
- “The author of the document added his reflections and interpretations as an appendix. He specified that, for them, the soul field is not a belief but an obvious truth. He also argues that the soul loses its individuality after death, but that memory and experience persist as part of the field. This fact would influence the philosophy and culture of EBOs, resulting in a society that doesn't fear death but which places no importance or reverence on individuality. This ‘belief’ compels them to seed life, shape it, nurture it, monitor it and influence it for the ultimate purpose of creating this apotheosis. Paradoxically, they have little or no respect for an individual's well-being.”
- “Please be advised that I'm speaking from memory of something I read more than 10 years ago, so take the following with a grain of salt. Also… note that this information comes from a document whose author was directly interacting with an EBO. It is not specified whether it was an ambassador, a crash survivor, a prisoner. The means of communication were not specified either.”

### Reactions

- They struggled with moderation, due to getting shadow-banned for use of a VPN, then claimed to be getting “disconcerting private messages” and later deleted their account.
- **Seems Legit:**
  - “I have a masters in biochemistry and a medical degree. This is likely a person with at the very minimum a degree in a biological field and with some years of lab work.”
  - “Awesome read. I've worked in a BSL3 lab. I can attest that this person, at the very least has actual hard-core lab experience.”
- **Seems Sus:**
  - “If I was writing up a fake story about alien genetics and microbiology, many of the things that OP wrote about would sound very complex to the layperson, but all something that is learned in a 300 level undergrad course in genetics.”
  - “He also said, "The medial toe is marginally longer than the distal toe." Day 1 of gross anatomy teaches you that, if he is describing a foot with only two "toes", he should have described it as a medial toe and a lateral toe. …I would expect someone at this level to know basic anatomical terms.”
- **He makes the right kind of mistakes:**
  - “Molecular biologists, anthropologists (like this guy), and large number of other subspecialists in biology simply do not understand anatomy and physiology to the same level and degree that a medical doctor would. This guy absolutely fucking nails the molecular biology jargon in this post, but he repeatedly makes minor mistakes in medical jargon or gross anatomy. This supports his description of his educational background. People with doctorates in molecular biology have a good passing knowledge of anatomy and physiology, but nowhere near the level of a medical doctor.”
  - “The EBO scientist offers plenty of speculation and makes several statements without offering supporting evidence. This is consistent with a Ph.D. graduate immediately hired into a technician-level job, who stays at that job for ~10 years, and then falls out of science.”
