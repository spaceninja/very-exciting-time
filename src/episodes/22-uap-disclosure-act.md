Huge news this week as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer introduces the UAP Disclosure Act of 2023! This is a bipartisan NDAA amendment that would introduce a JFK-style UAP record review board who would review all government records with the intent to release all UAP items within 25 years. Huge! We talk about the implications of this, why it matters, and what the limitations might be. We also discuss the upcoming House UAP hearing, which has been scheduled for July 26, and the increasing willingness of Congress to take the topic seriously. Buckle up!

## Upcoming Congressional UAP Hearings:

- House Oversight Chair James Comer and Speaker Kevin McCarthy have signed off on holding a hearing on July 26, with Burchett and Luna taking the lead.
- Rep. Comer:
  - “They’re very passionate about that issue. I’ve been surprised at the number of questions I’ve received on that hearing, so I think **there’s a lot of interest**.”
- Rep. Luna:
  - “We got the hearing – so we got the date confirmed. We’ll be releasing names about a week prior. I promise you guys won’t be disappointed.”
  - “We have some great witnesses that have worked in previous administrations—Democrat, Republican.”
  - “So what we’re focusing on is, one, getting the information out to the American people: Clearly, this is a big galaxy that we live in and that there is **very likely technology that we are unaware of where it’s come from**—and so, does this pose a national security threat? …But it’s important that instead of trying to make this conspiratorial and poo-pooing it, that people are actually understanding that it’s **very likely that there’s other life forms out there** and that we’re not alone in this universe and that we can address these things with a scientific mindset.”
- Rep Tim Burchett:
  - “**That’s what it is about: aliens.** …I think people deserve to know.”
  - “We have the Pentagon pushing against us, calling some of our witnesses, telling them ‘don’t go testify before this committee’ and if we have to we’ll use the power of subpoena, we’ll bring them in there and make them tell the truth, because this thing thing has been covered up.”
  - “Are all these pilots lying, risking their lives, their careers, their retirement, their reputations, everything they have, for something like this? I say no. They’re not lying. They’re telling the truth. Something is going on, let’s get to the bottom of it.
- Rep. Mike Gallagher:
  - Asked about UAPs: **“Aliens. Just call them aliens, okay?”**
  - Asked about Grusch claims: “I’m not allowed to comment on them, but I think they should be taken seriously. Obviously, Grusch’s background is legit: military, Intel., high level security clearance, so you can’t just dismiss him. …Because you can’t dismiss him, you’re left with two possibilities: One, he’s telling the truth. Two, he’s misinformed.”
- Ross Coulthart:
  - “Within a very short period of time there is going to be some revelation, particularly from the Congress, which makes this evidence so incontrovertible that the legacy media is going to have to play catch-up.”
- Sen. Marco Rubio:
  - “One of two things is happening here. Either they’re telling the truth, and that would be the biggest story in human history, or we have people in really important positions in government who are crazy, and are making up stories, and are still in positions of importance. Either one of those is a big problem. So we’ve gotta figure out which one of these two it is, because the second one in particular would be very troubling. All we know is claims people have made. These are credible people that have done and continue to do important work for the country. And by law, we’re required when they come forward as whistleblowers to take their claims seriously and investigate them.”
- Admiral Wilson is waiting to be called:
  - “The only thing I wonder about is why, as all this moves along, why Congress hasn’t said, ‘We’d like to hear from Admiral Wilson, because he’s supposed to be the Wilson Memo guy,’ right?”
  - Hints he hasn’t been asked due to his previous denials: “I just know there are – I’m pretty sure there are – zealots on this one side, and sometimes I wonder if you speak the truth and the truth doesn’t agree with what they believe, they don’t want to talk to you anymore.”
  - “If anybody ever particularly invited me to testify or meet with them about the Wilson Memo and things like that, I would’ve been more than willing to do so, but nobody ever did.”

## UAP Disclosure Bill

- Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced a new amendment to the NDAA on Friday:
  - “I’m introducing new legislation to declassify government records related to unidentified anomalous phenomena and UFOs as an amendment to the NDAA, modeled after the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act.”
  - “The American public has a right to learn about technologies of unknown origins, non-human intelligence, and unexplainable phenomena. We are not only working to declassify what the government has previously learned about these phenomena but to **create a pipeline for future research to be made public**. I am honored to carry on the legacy of my mentor and dear friend, Harry Reid and fight for the transparency that the public has long demanded surrounding these unexplained phenomena.”
- Press Release:
  - “[Congress] uncovered a vast web of individuals and groups with ideas and stories to share. While these stories have varying levels of credibility, the sheer number and variety has led some in Congress to believe that the Executive Branch was concealing important information regarding UAPs over broad periods of time.”
  - “Congress recognizes that these records – if they exist – were likely concealed under the good faith goal of protecting national security. However, hiding that information from both Congress and the public at large is simply unacceptable. Our goal is to work cooperatively with the executive branch to responsibly disclose these documents and bring the topic into the public sphere in a process that the American people can trust.”
- Bill would:
  - “direct the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to create a collection of records to be known as the UAP Records Collection and direct every government office to identify which records would fall into the collection, with a 300 day deadline. The UAP Records Collection would carry the presumption of immediate disclosure, which means that a review board would have to provide a reasoning for the documents to stay classified.”
  - “After the UAP Records Collection is created, the legislation will create a UAP Records Review Board, an independent agency, which would consider if a UAP record would qualify for postponement of disclosure.”
    - The president would appoint the nine-person board, with Senate approval.
    - The intent is to select a group of people who would push for disclosure while protecting sensitive intelligence collection methods.
    - Board members must be:
      - Impartial citizens with no previous involvement with UAP programs
      - Should include at least 1 current or former national security official (Lue?), 1 current or former foreign service official, 1 scientist or engineer, 1 economist, 1 historian, and 1 sociologist
      - Board members will be given necessary security clearances
  - “At the latest, each UAP record must be publicly disclosed in full …no later than 25 years after the record is created, unless the President certifies that continued postponement is necessary because of a direct harm to national security.”
  - This would mean stuff like Roswell (1947) would have to be released right away, The Nimitz Tictac incident (2004) would be in 6 years, while the Roosevelt Gimbal incident (2015) would be in 17 years.
  - Clarify that UAP includes anything previously described, such as UFOs, flying discs, saucers, etc., to avoid shenanigans.
    - Also clarifies that UAP are distinguished by the five observables Lou has talked about, plus one more: “(i) Instantaneous acceleration absent apparent inertia. (ii) Hypersonic velocity absent a ther- mal signature and sonic shockwave. (iii) Transmedium (such as space-to- ground and air-to-undersea) travel. (iv) Positive lift contrary to known aerodynamic principles. (v) Multispectral signature control.(vi) Physical or invasive biological ef- fects to close observers and the environ- ment.”
  - Also defines NHI: “The term “non-human intelligence” means any sentient intelligent non-human lifeform regardless of nature or ultimate origin that may be responsible for unidentified anomalous phenomena or of which the Federal Government has become aware.”
- One more thing:
  - “Additionally, the federal government shall have **eminent domain** over any and all recovered technologies of unknown origin (TUO) and biological evidence of non-human intelligence (NHI) that may be controlled by private persons or entities in the interests of the public good.”
  - Related to Ross’ concerns last week about legal issues related to IP, and private craft recoveries.
    - “If it crashes in your backyard, you don’t get to keep it.”
- Bipartisan support:
  - Bill is co-sponsored by Republican Senator Mike Rounds (a member of both the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Armed Services Committee), as well as R. Sen. Marco Rubio, D. Sen. Kristen Gillibrand, R. Sen. Todd Young, and D. Sen. Martin Heinrich
  - Similar bill was introduced in the house by Rep. Burchett.
  - Matthew Pines, the Director of Intelligence at Krebs Stamos Group: “Note that it was drafted w/ bipartisan concurrence in complete secrecy. Nary a leak until NYT got the 24 hrs heads up (from someone…), but it’s clear that they didn’t get the full bill. Just a bomb dropped on the DC press…”
- Lots of press coverage, including: [NBC news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pat1Wluomqw) , [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/senators-move-require-release-us-government-ufo-records-2023-07-14/) , [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/4097653-senators-to-offer-amendment-to-require-government-to-make-ufo-records-public/) , [Politico](https://www.politico.com/minutes/congress/07-14-2023/defense-bills-meet-ufos/) , [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/chuck-schumer-declassify-ufo-secrets-jfk-records-1812978) , and:
- The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/us/politics/ufo-records-schumer.html) wrote about the measure
  - First we’ve heard from them on topic since Grusch
  - Doesn’t mention Grusch by name, only “Government assertions that they do not have the remains of crashed alien spacecraft… have been challenged by some former officials who believe the government is not divulging all that it knows.”
  - Garry Nolan: “Perhaps they don’t want to remind anyone that though they were given the opportunity (as was the Washington Post) to run the story they demurred.”
- Reactions
  - Chris Mellon: “Although this is very encouraging, until & unless the overly restrictive UAP security classification guide is revised, there will be little public benefit as virtually all recent data, including UAP videos, will be classified. Congress should press ahead for this guidance to be revised.”
    - Counterpoint: “Under Schumer’s legislation, the president could decide to delay material the commission has chosen to release based on national security concerns. But the measure would establish a timetable to release documents and codify the presumption that the material should be public.”
  - Ross Coulthart: “These proposed UAP laws are quite extraordinary. They openly concede the possibility that someone is concealing recovered Non-Earth technologies, and biological evidence - bodies? If passed, there is no going back from what these laws might soon reveal.”
  - NewsNation correspondent Joe Khalil: “Sen. Majority LeaderSchumer backing legislation to declassify UAP/ UFO records is significant in that he’s likely the highest ranking member of Congress to ever get behind a measure like this.”
  - Marik Von Rennenkampff (former DOD, opinion writer at The Hill): “Given the decades-long stigma associated with UAP, the level of credibility, specificity and corroboration of the underlying intel must have been _extraordinary_ to make it a priority for the US’ top lawmaker.”
  - [@conterammundi on Twitter](https://twitter.com/conterammundi/status/1679654188127784961) : There is a near zero percent chance that Majority Leader Schumer would introduce this bill without direct and intimate consultation with the White House.
    - [Swank5000 on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/14zvrlr/comment/js17enr/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) : “Especially with the presidential campaigns and election around the corner, it is nearly a 100% guarantee that they are coordinating on this. They (Biden and Schumer) are the #1 and #2 leaders of their party, and arguably the two most powerful individuals in D.C. No doubt in my mind they are in lockstep on this.”
    - [Search Prestigious on Reddit:](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/14zrp37/the_impact_of_schumers_recent_legislation/) : “Chuck Schumer isn’t just any “senator” he is the senate majority leader. He would not have done anything without the blessing of the Whitehouse and guarantees there is actually something to disclose.. Control of the senate rests on a knifes edge. Imagine all of this goes no where… They wouldn’t take that chance.”
    - LibTimes this morning: “Sources have disclosed to Liberation Times that, although fronting the new legislation, Senator Chuck Schumer’s staff and others in the Senate have been in coordination with various quarters of the U.S. government, including the White House and its National Security Council to create the language.”
