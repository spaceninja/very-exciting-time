<p class="intro">
  We started this podcast because since 2017 there have been shocking
  revelations, from news of secret Pentagon programs to confirmed Navy videos of
  astonishing craft. In a nutshell, now that the government has admitted that
  UFOs are real (or at least that the videos were authentic), it raises a
  natural question. If UFOs are real, what else? Suddenly some of these other
  parts of the phenomenon that seemed unlikely are pulled into the realm of the
  possible. Even if the truth is more mundane that you’re hoping, if
  <em>any</em> of this turns out to be true… it’s a very exciting&nbsp;time!

## Scott Vandehey

Scott Vandehey is a web developer in sunny Portland, Oregon. He's been fascinated by the phenomenon his whole life, but especially since the rapid progress brought about by the 2017 New York Times article. When he's not excitedly talking to Chuck, he's voraciously consuming podcasts and documentaries about UFOs, acting as DM to a long-running D&D campaign, and raising two kids with his (also tolerant) wife, Annie.
