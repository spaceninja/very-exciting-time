A podcast by a UFO nerd and his tolerant friend. Because if UFOs are realâ€¦ what else? If any of this turns out to be true, it's a very exciting time!

## Scott Vandehey

Scott Vandehey is a web developer in sunny Portland, Oregon. He's been fascinated by the UFO phenomenon his whole life, but especially since the rapid progress brought about by the 2017 New York Times article. When he's not excitedly talking to Chuck, he's voratiously consuming podcasts and documentaries about the topic, acting as DM to a long-running D&D campaign, and raising two kids with his (also tolerant) wife, Annie.
